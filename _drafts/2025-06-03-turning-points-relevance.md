## Disasters and decisions keep your turning points relevant

The best thing about using disasters and decisions is that they force you to build turing points that are _directly relevant to your plot_. I can't tell you how valuable this is. 

Story conflict only works if your audience feels like it matters. If it doesn't feel relevant, even the most world-ending stakes will be hard to care about. And if it _does_ feel relevant, even a seemingly small-time challenge can loom large.

Unless you're a business strategist or economist, you probably don't normally give much thought to the phenomenon of big box stores pushing out small, family-owned businesses. But because the arrival of Fox Books matters to Kathleen Kelly, it matters to us.

When you use disasters and decisions to place your turning points, that sets up guardrails that automatically steer your plot toward relevance. It's like putting bumpers in the gutters at a bowling alley. It doesn't 100% guarrantee that you'll strike every time, but it keeps you on track.
