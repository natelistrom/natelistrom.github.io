<p class="dropCap">I have been fascinated with story structure for years. I&rsquo;ve long felt that there ought to be a way to harmonize the various story structure theories out there. Surely, there&rsquo;s some core underlying commonality behind all these similar but slightly different structures?</p>

This notion isn't new to me, of course. Many have come to this conclusion and made their own attempts at harmonization.

In my own practice, the pursuit led me to what I call the "Western Character-Event" structure. 

- I use "Western" because I'm most confident of this structure in stories from Europe and North America.
- I use "Character-Event" to describe the intertwining of external, event-motivated plot and internal, character-motivated drama.

## The 15 elements of structure

My structure is made up of seven key turning points and the eight phases that connect them.

![A plot diagram with dots for significant events and lines connecting them. There is a gentle rise toward the midpoint. After that, the line dips in to a deep trough and then rises again to the climax.](/assets/img/character-event-plot.png)

### Ordinary world

The ordinary world introduces the protagonist. The audience gets to see the lie she believes and how it has trapped her. They also get to see her admirable qualities and develop empathy for her.

### Call to adventure

The call to adventure is the first key turning point. In it, the protagonist faces a moment in which she's confronted with the story problem in a way she can't ignore.

### Debate

In the debate, the protagonist reacts to the challenge of the call to adventure and faces a dilemma. Why change her plan and take on this new challenge? What will she gain or lose? She considers the cost.

The purpose of the debate is to prove that the protagonist is a reasonable person. She doesn't accept the story goal simply because it's convenient to the plot. She's motivated by emotion and logic and the demands of her situation. 

The debate doesn't have to be long or drawn out. In_Jurassic Park_ it's just a moment's hesitation. But it's there.

Sometimes, the challenge can be daunting and the protagonist extremely hesitant to accept the call. In these cases, there's often an additional event that tips the balances and pushes the protagonist to the decision.

### Decision to cross the threshold

The decision to cross the threshold is the moment in which the protagonist accepts the story goal. Without this, there's no story. Once it happens, it's game on. The story has officially begun.

In my opinion, the decision to cross the threshold must be "on screen." However, it doesn't need to be explicit. All that's necessary is that the audience knows that the protagonist has committed.

### First steps in a new world

Snyder calls this the "fun and games" section. (Snyder, 80ff) It provides what he calls the "promise of the premise," the idea that whatever concept would be used to advertise the story, this is where the audience gets to see it. (Snyder, 81) It's generally lighter in tone and plays up opportunities for wonder and excitement and humor.

In this section, the both the audience and the protagonist get to learn, together, about the new situation. The protagonist picks up rules, allies, and tools that will be useful later in unexpected ways. (Vogler, 14, 166; Campbell, 350) This may be the part of the story in which the protagonist picks up the key element or insight she'll need in order to eventually overcome the story problem, but she won't realize that yet. (Vogler, 48; Weiland, 94)

Introduce a way of being that is fundamentally different than what the protagonist is used to from her ordinary world. "[She] glimpses, for the first time, what life might be like without the Lie." (Weiland, Characters, 56) If she's aware of that conflict, though, the protagonist will be tempted to double-down on the lie she believes. The difference makes her desire a return to "home" even more. (Mazin) 

As an audience, this helps us learn more about the protagonist. In the ordinary world we saw her living in her lie in her comfortable home environment. Now, we see her attempting to continue living in her lie in a new context. Same worldview but different inputs. The contrast can be revealing.

### First trial

Things aren't all fun and games. There's a moment somewhere in the first half of the second act in which the tone starts to shift. The protagonist meets opposition, which tests her. (Vogler, 14) She feels the presence of the antagonistic force for the first time in the new world. (Freytag, Five Parts and Three Crises) Her plan, which seems so far to be going swimmingly, encounters a bump.

In _Jurassic Park_, this is when the scientists sit down for lunch before going on the tour, and Dr. Malcolm gives his speech. "Your scientists were so busy thinking about what they could do that they didn't think about whether they should do it." The philosophical conflict between characters foreshadows the physical conflict to come.

In _Star Wars: A New Hope_, it's when Luke gets attacked by thugs in Mos Eisley and Obi-Wan must rescue him. Luke is out of his safe old life as a farm kid. Things in the city can be deadly.

### Escalating combat

The escalating combat phase is the section that's most poorly defined in my brain. I find it difficult to write with confidence. My interest in defining story structure is in part an attempt to address the challenge of the "messy middle," and I feel that this phase of the story, more than any other, exemplifies how I haven't yet totally resolved this difficulty.

It leads up to the midpoint and is marked by increasing back and forth pressure between the protagonist's attempts to follow her plan and the antagonistic force's attempts to thwart it. (Truby, 48)

Vogler calls this the "approach" and suggests that it might include a sense of preparation and anticipation, setbacks and "fair weather friends" leaving, and the protagonist and allies recommitting themselves to the mission. (Vogler, 170-177)

Writer-director Craig Mazin suggests that during this phase (or, perhaps, at the first trial), the protagonist may begin to experience doubt about the lie she believes. (Mazin; Weiland Characters, 56) Setbacks demonstrate that her old way of being won't always work in the new world. (Weiland Characters, 53-55)

### Midpoint

The midpoint is a kind of centerpiece to the story. (Field, 61) Similar to the call to adventure, some significant outward event imposes demands upon the protagonist, which she cannot ignore. 

Something happens, which the audience knows is catastrophic for protagonist's plans (but she might not yet realize that). It's a disaster that puts the audience on the edge of their seats, hoping against hope to avert it . . . while at the same time feeling delicious anticipation at its inevitability and guilty satisfaction when it comes.

Like the "promise of the premise" in the first part of act 2a, the outward events of the midpoint are defining for the type of story you're telling. (Bell, 74) If it's an adventure story, expect a big action set piece. If it's a romance, expect this moment to find the lovers in a defining moment together.

Both Coyne and Hauge suggest that this is the true moment of no return in the story.  (Coyne, 188; Hauge, article) Before, the protagonist had the chance to turn back. From this point on, she has no way out. She has only two options: press forward or fail.

In a character-event story, the midpoint sees a shift from the central battle plane of the story being external to internal. (Booker, 243)

Snyder claims that the midpoint is often a moment of "false victory." The protagonist may finally achieve her outward goal, but it's hollow. What she really needs is to learn to change. (Snyder, 84)

Mazin says that the protagonist experiences a "moment of acting in harmony" with the story's thematic truth, either in her own action or in the action of someone she observes. (Mazin)

John Yorke says this is the moment when the protagonist first experiences the "truth" of the story, though she doesn't yet know how to integrate it.  (Yorke, Loc 1296, Loc 1448, Loc 1485) "At the midpoint a character’s need will overcome [her] want for the very first time." (Yorke, Loc 2469)

### Charging the gates

The charging the gates phase is another one that's not quite sharply defined in my mind. Snyder calls it the "toughest part of the [story]." (Snyder, 85) Freytag calls it the "most difficult part of the drama." (Freytag, Five Parts and Three Crises)

The best thing that I can say about it is that it is the first phase in which the fundamental gravity of the story has shifted from the external event story to the internal character story.

Mazin puts it this way: "As the demands of the narrative begin to overwhelm the hero, the hero begins to realize that her limitations aren’t physical but thematic." (Mazin)

The charging the gates phase is the last phase in which the protagonist behaves fully in the lie she believes. At the midpoint, she experienced the truth, but in either subtle or dramatic ways, she still refuses to integrate it.

Following Swain's scene-sequel cycle, the external event story should show the protagonist's reaction to what happened at the midpoint.

In both _Jurassic Park_ and _Pride and Prejudice_, we see the protagonists in retreat. Dr. Grant tries to save the children and find a place safe from the rampant dinosaurs. Elizabeth rides home to Longhorn, mind swirling with the knowledge she's just gained about Darcy and its implications for her, her family, Bingley, and Wickham.

Freytag suggests that there's a pause and shift at this point:

> "Up to the climax, the interest has been firmly fixed in the direction in which the chief characters are moving. After the deed is consummated, a pause ensues. Suspense must now be excited in what is new." (Freytag, Five Parts and Three Crises)

Vogler proposes a moment for a "campfire-type" scenes in which "the [protagonist] and companions gather around a fire or its equivalent to review the recent events. It's . . . an opportunity for jokes and boasting. There is understandable relief at having survived death."  (Vogler, 206-207)

But if the quiet is there, we can't stay in it for long. The goal is not yet claimed, and the protagonist must turn from her reaction to a continued pursuit.
She "rises from the drama and trauma of the Midpoint and grits [her] teeth. [She] responds with an action that fights back." (Weiland, not Character, 104) Weiland suggests that in this phase, the protagonist "mov[es] forward confidently, taking control of the conflict." (Weiland, Characters, 66)

But it can't be easy. The story world's antagonistic forces fight back. (Hauge, video) This phase sees an extreme resistance mounting as we charge inexorably toward disaster.

### All is lost

The all is lost moment is a disaster that makes it seemingly impossible for the protagonist to achieve her story goal. In a romance, it's when the lovers break up. (Harmon, The Juicy Details) In a murder mystery, it's when the key suspect turns up dead, exposing the fact that the protagonist misinterpreted the clues all along. In a police procedural, it's when the station chief pulls the protagonist off the case.

Aside from the defining moment in the climax, the all is lost may be the most significant swing in the story. It's a kind of breaking point. All through the second act up to this point, the back and forth between the protagonist's plans and the antagonistic force has been building. Now, at the all is lost, the antagonistic force surges into apparent victory, utterly destroying the protagonist's hopes of reaching her goal.

Snyder introduces what he calls the "whiff of death": 

> "At the All Is Lost moment, stick in something, anything that involves a death . . . The thing you show dying . . . will resonate and make that All Is Lost moment all the more poignant." (Snyder, 86-87)

To Snyder, this death is where "the old world, the old character, the old way of thinking dies." (Snyder, 86-87) To my mind, that happens in the next phase, the dark night of the soul. 

However, there is absolutely a moment of death at the all is lost: The death of the protagonist's dream.

In _Pride and Prejudice_, the all is lost is when Elizabeth's sister Lydia elopes with a scoundrel, casting Elizabeth's whole family into social disrepute. At this point in the story, Elizabeth has just begun to see another side to Darcy. She has begun to have a cautious, growing regard for him, and it's thus even more devastating when Lydia's indiscretion rears its ugly head. Elizabeth knows that the one thing Darcy holds above all others is social reputation. His nature is to abhor disrepute. It's the one thing he cannot overlook. Thus, now that she actually cares about him, he is forever beyond her reach. 

### Dark night of the soul

The dark night of the soul is a phase of reaction and dilemma. The protagonist must deal with the implications of what happened at the all is lost. She grieves over the death she experienced there.

The purpose of the dark night of the soul is to force the protagonist to recognize that she must abandon her old way of being. (Cron, Page 86) She sees fully, perhaps for the first time, the lie she believed for what it is. (Weiland, Characters, 75-77) Up to this point, she held onto it through the story, even as she experienced glimpses of a better way. But at the all is lost, her old way utterly, irrevocably failed her.

Author James Scott Bell talks about a "mirror moment" when the protagonist is forced to confront herself in a clear-eyed, honest manner. Who is she really, deep down? And who does she want to become?

> "The biggest changes we make in our own lives occur when we are thrust into a crisis. Enduring fiction is built upon that same thing . . . It's only when we feel we must change that we do change. The mirror moment makes that clear to the character and, most important of all, to the reader." (Bell, 74)

We don't always like what we see in the mirror, and your protagonist is no different. It's not uncommon, in reacting, for the protagonist to initially want to double down on her lie and return home, defeated. It feels easier to give up on the goal than to accept change. (Harmon, The Juicy Details)

> "The hero is going to retreat . . . into their [lie] . . . They're saying to themselves, 'I knew this was stupid. I knew I never should have gone for this.'" (Hauge, video)

But of course, your protagonist can't return and be truly satisfied. Not now that she's tasted the truth.

This introduces the crucial dilemma of the entire story: Will the protagonist change? Can she do it, knowing the unbearable cost? There can be no easy options here. It's the central choice on which the entire story hangs.

At the all is lost, the protagonist faced the death of her outward dream. Here, at the end of the dark night of the soul, the protagonist becomes conscious that she's being challenged to consider another, more difficult death: the death of her old way of being.

> "Shrek doesn't want his swamp back anymore. He wants love, but he is also not willing to do what is required to try and get it. He's trapped. And this is why they call it the low point. It's not random. It's not the low point because the books say page 90 is the low point. It's the low point because your character is lost and in a whole lot of trouble. Their goal in the beginning, which was to go backwards to the beginning to achieve stasis, to re-achieve stasis, that goal is in shambles. Their anti-thematic belief, whatever it was that they clung to in the beginning of this story, it's been exposed as a sham. And the enormity of the real goal that now faces them is impossibly daunting. They can't yet accept the theme because it's too scary. When your core values are gone and when you aren't ready to replace them with new values, well, you might as well be dead." (Mazin)

> "Faced with the ultimate crisis, the structure asks of the protagonist one simple question: will you revert and die, or change and live? It's the death of the old self . . . so that the new person can live." (Yorke, Loc 1934)

The first death was outside her control and against her wishes. This second death is something she must enter into willingly. And because of that — because she really _does_ have a choice — it's all the more difficult. (And all the more satisfying for the audience if she chooses rightly.)

Who will she choose to be?

#### A glimmer of hope

The dark night of the soul is similar to the debate in that it is a period when the protagonist struggles with a central dilemma. Also similar to the debate, the dark night of the soul may have an additional event that clarifies things for the protagonist and helps her end the dilemma and make a decision. I call this, for lack of a better word, an epiphany. 

In [idea stories]({% post_url 2024-04-02-beginning-middle-end-4 %}) like mysteries, it may be a literal epiphany. Often, it's introduced by a reflection character who comes along at the right time and says something unrelated, which suddenly snaps the pieces together for the protagonist.

Although this may be a "convenient" rescue, it isn't a cheat. The depth of the struggle that the protagonist endured through the dark night of the soul proves she deserves the epiphany. She's [earned it]({% post_url 2023-08-12-deus-ex-machina-and-satisfying-story-ending %}).

### Recommitment

The recommitment is the protagonist's decision to change in order to achieve the story goal. It's the key moment in any character story. Everything else is just supporting context for this one, crucial moment of change.

In the recommitment, the protagonist definitively rejects the lie she believed and, for the first time, fully and completely embraces the idea of the thematic truth.

When plot theorists talk about death and rebirth motifs, this is why. At the recommitment, the protagonist dies to her old self and raises anew. (Vogler, 16) (Weiland, Characters, 78)

McKee talks about the gap being the place where "the human spirit and the world meet." It's "the nexus of story." In other words: change and catharsis. Adjustment between the way we would choose for the world to be, the frustrating encounter with the fact that it is not so, and the cathartic release when we adjust ourselves and integrate to the world as it is. (McKee, 152)

This doesn't yet mean that she's consummated her decision — that happens later, at the defining moment. But at the recommitment she resolves to embrace it.

If the story has negative, tragic arc, the decision at the recommitment is inverted. The protagonist sees the lie and truth for what they are, acknowledges them, and then chooses not to change, doubling down on her broken way of living.

Once the protagonist commits herself to a new way of living in the character story, the external event story may reward her decision by giving her unexpected insight to help solve the external plot.

This triggers the next phase: a race to the end.

### Ascending the tower

Faith must be fulfilled in action. At the recommitment, the protagonist fully accepted the truth. But she has not yet fully embodied it. (Snyder, 89)

Her goals in the story are now properly aligned. When she crossed the threshold into Act II, she might have been pursuing a false goal that fit her old, broken worldview. Now, and she enters Act III, she is finally pursuing the true goal. But that goal is not yet achieved. In the Ascending the tower phase, she must enact a plan to go get it. (Yorke, Loc 1945)

But it can never be that easy. As she turns, clear-eyed for the first time, toward the prize at the end, the entire antagonistic force of the story will throw its weight against her. She made her decision; now, we see whether or not she can stick to it. This introduces a phase of steeply escalating conflict, a "fight from the low point to the end." (Anders)

Snyder suggests that the protagonist must "[dispatch] all the bad guys ascending order. Lieutenants and henchmen die first, then the boss." (Snyder, 91) In this gauntlet, the protagonist uses all the tools and tricks that she learned along the way. (Snyder, 90) During the first half of the second act, we got to see the "promise of the premise" in which the interesting ideas of the story's special world were put on display. Here, these ideas may come back in a sort of final review.

The overall trajectory of the Ascending the Tower phase is up and up and up. Tension increases. So does pace. It gets harder and harder for the protagonist to achieve success. One by one, her skills and armor are broken away. She sustains terrible blows and receives harrowing wounds. But with each rebuff, she increases her own resolve. As her physical strength falls away, her moral conviction rises to shine.

In Pride and Prejudice, we see Lady Catherine DeBourgh visit Longborn, attacking Elizabeth's character and social standing. In Star Wars: A New Hope, the Rebel Alliance attacks the approaching Death Star and, one by one, Luke's fellow starfighter pilots are shot down or disabled.

Finally, the protagonist stands toe to toe with the ultimate antagonistic force in the story, and she faces one last challenge. It's a terrible duel, and often leads to a point at which the protagonist is in mortal peril. She falls to the ground, seemingly defeated. Her resolve wavers. Maybe the thematic truth wasn't right, after all? 

Writer and director Craig Mazin talks about a moment of final temptation when the protagonist is given one last chance to revert to the lie. (Mazin)

On the edge of victory, we taste defeat. This is what editor Shawn Coyne calls the "hero at the mercy of the villain." (Coyne, _____) It's a moment of maximum tension and contrast.

### Defining moment

The defining moment is a sort of inverted disaster. All through the story up to this point, disasters have come from outside the protagonist and ruined her plan. Now, here, at the high point of action, the protagonist is the one who pushes back against the world and makes a difference.

The protagonist rises from the blood and the dirt and the flames. With her last shred of hope, she makes a final, desperate swing: a singular integration of moral and physical action, magnificently aligned with the thematic truth of the story. (Swain, 125-126) The decision she made at the recommitment is tested with finality, and blow strikes home. The antagonistic force is suddenly, unexpectedly, utterly and completely defeated. The protagonist emerges victorious.

The purpose of the defining moment is to furnish definitive proof that the protagonist's character has changed. (Weiland, 118) In the words of writer and director Craig Mazin, she must "embody the truth of the theme . . . through action." (Mazin) 

Both the external event plot and the internal character plot merge in this moment of shining vindication. The protagonist has learned her lesson, internalized it, and applied it. She has made the ultimate sacrifice, giving up herself completely, and the story world rewards her for that exceptional choice with triumph.

### Resolution

The resolution is a sort of upside down reaction phase, the natural response to the inverted disaster of the defining moment.

The resolution is proof. It shows that the protagonist's character change has suck. (Weiland, Characters, 122) She didn't just dabble with change and then revert. She's a new person. In the resolution, you show what her life is like now that she has left her lie behind and embraced a truer way of living. (Weiland, Characters, 96)

You can think of the ordinary world and resolution as being paired bookends. In the ordinary world, you introduce the protagonist and show her acting in accordance with her lie. In the resolution, you show her now that she is acting in truth. (Mazin)

You can even heighten that contrast by showing how the protagonist behaves differently when confronted with the same situation. For example, in Dr. Grant's introduction in Jurassic Park, we see him disliking children. In the closing image of the film, he sits contentedly, a child at each side.

> "The final image . . . is the opposite of the opening image. It is your proof that change has occurred and that it's real." (Snyder, 90)

In addition to the protagonist's character change — or, more correctly, because of it — the resolution explains your story. The story world either rewards or punishes the protagonist for what she has done, and this judgment shows your audience whether or not you agree with her choice. It is a sort of concluding statement in your thematic argument. (Mazin)

> "What your reader seeks is . . . the feeling, 'This is as it should be.'" (Swain, 205)

## Disasters and decisions are the key turning points

I borrow heavily from Dwight Swain's scene-sequel theory, which focuses on "disasters" and "decisions" as key turning points.

- **Disasters** are external events that disrupt the protagonist's plan, forcing the protagonist into a period of reaction and dilemma.
- **Decisions** are internal turning points in which the protagonist ends a dilemma by decisively committing to a new plan of action.

As you can see, these feed into one another. The progatonist begins with a goal and plan. As she pursues her plan, the external world throws increasing resistance at her until there is a disaster that makes it impossible for her to continue in the current plan. She experiences reaction, reeling from the disaster. As she re-orients, she realizes she faces a dilemma. What will she do now? The choice isn't easy. None of the options is perfect. But she must choose something, and indeed she does. (It's in her decisions that her character is made most visible.) She makes the decision, settling on a new plan, and the cycle repeats itself.
