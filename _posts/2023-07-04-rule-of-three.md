<p class="dropCap">The rule of three is a powerful and efficient, three-unit storytelling structural mechanic. It leverages human psychology to set up and pay off audience expectation. Where storytelling techniques like <a href="{% post_url 2022-12-19-comparison-creates-meaning %}">comparison</a> and <a href="{% post_url 2023-01-12-bracketing %}">bracketing</a> are about communicating <em>meaning</em> to your audience, you can use the rule of three to deliver lasting, memorable <em>satisfaction</em>.</p>

You construct the rule of three by stringing together three things in such a way that audiences can tell they are similar or related. This creates a progression among the items. For example, in the words of webcomic author and _Writing Excuses_ podcast co-host Howard Tayler, it's, &ldquo;beat, beat, punchline. Thing one, thing two, thing three, where we are escalating . . . We have three beats, and the third one is the longest, and the third one is the most specific.&rdquo; <sup>{% include sanderson-2016.html %}</sup>

The rule of three appears in many forms of storytelling. It is, perhaps, most obvious in folk tales, like the tale of _The Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf_, _Goldilocks and the Three Bears_, or _The Little Girl and the Swan Geese_. (In the first two examples, “three” is even in the name.) But the rule of three isn't limited to children's stories. You can find it applied to all levels of story, from line-level prose and dialog to individual beats to scenes to whole sequences and acts. The existence of story trilogies speaks to the power of the form.

One reason for the ubiquity of the rule of three is its efficiency. Three is the minimum number of items needed to first establish a trajectory and then pay it off.

## How it works: trajectory and payoff

Under the hood, the rule of three works by harnessing our human brains’ capacity recognize patterns and make predictions.

Imagine, for a moment, that you draw two dots on a sheet of paper.

![description](/assets/img/rule-of-three-11.png)

An observer could look at those two dots and mentally draw a line connecting them. (In fact, because of the way our brains work, it’s likely that your brain will at least do this briefly.)

Seeing the mental line between the dots, an observer’s brain could extend the pattern and make a reasonable prediction about where a third dot might be drawn. In essence, you’ve created a trajectory.

![description](/assets/img/rule-of-three-12.png)

We humans are especially good at making these kids of predictive inferences. It’s built into us. Author and story coach Lisa Cron puts it well: “We’re wired to predict what will happen next, and _the way we do this is by charting patterns_.” <sup>{% include cron-2012.html %} Page 159</sup> (Emphasis mine.) When we see what looks like a partial pattern, we almost can’t help but predict how the pattern will complete.

The rule of three leverages this human tendency toward pattern-based predictions, but rather than dots on a graph, it does this with story units.

- The hunter saw the stag. (beat one)
- He raised the rifle to his shoulder and aimed . . . (beat two)

The trajectory is set. The audience has an expectation. The hunter will pull the trigger. The gun will fire. The stag will die. (Or, the hunter will miss, and the stag will escape.)

The first two units give a promise to the audience, creating expectation. For a satisfactory experience, that expectation must be paid off. That’s what the third unit does.

## Variations on a theme

In his systematic classification of Russion folktales, _Morphology of the Folk Tale_, folklorist Vladimir Propp identifies three different variants of the rule of three:

> "Repetition may appear as a uniform distribution (three tasks, three years ’ service), as an accumulation (the third task is the most difficult, the third battle the worst), or may twice produce negative results before the third, successful outcome." <sup>{% include propp-2009.html %} Location 1555.</sup>

Journalist and author Christopher Booker, in his landmark work, _The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories_, adds a fourth variation. <sup>{% include booker-2004.html %} Page 231.</sup> His taxonomy is as follows: 

- simple (what Propp calls "uniform distribution")
- progressive (what Propp calls "accumulation")
- contrasting
- dialectical

#### Simple and progressive

Both simple and progressive have to deal with items that are more-or-less the same to one another. The main difference that Propp and Booker draw is that in the progressive form, sets of three build, their items increasing in strength or value (either positively or negatively). <sup>{% include booker-2004.html %} Page 231.</sup>

But even in the simple form, the items are placed in sequence. That sequence creates an implicit hierarchy, even if the value of the items themselves is the same. Thus, both simple and progressive expressions of the rule of three are, pragmatically, pretty similar. They have to do with similar things in sequence.

![description](/assets/img/rule-of-three-14.png)

In the story of _The Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf_, the straw, wood, and brick used by pigs to build their houses are a great example of the progressive form. The materials create a set, each of whose items progressively increase in strength.

#### Contrasting

The contrasting three is a form where the first two items are negative or deficient in some way and stand in comparison to the third, which is positive and fulfilling. (Or, in tragedy, the first two are positive, but the protagonist rejects them and ends on a negative.)

![description](/assets/img/rule-of-three-15.png)

This form also shows up in the story of _The Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf_. The first two houses, being built of weaker materials, are blown down by the wolf. The owners perish. The third house, built of stronger material, is the only one sturdy enough to withstand the wolf’s attack. It passes the test. The wolf goes away defeated, and the third pig lives.

#### Dialectical

The last form, which Booker calls “dialectical,” is a form where the first and second items are in contrast to one another, but are alike in that neither one is acceptable. Only by bringing together elements of both in synthesis is a satisfying conclusion found in the third item. <sup>{% include booker-2004.html %} Page 231.</sup>

![description](/assets/img/rule-of-three-16.png)

As Booker points out, the story of _Goldilocks and the Three Bears_ plays with this form quite liberally, with its three bowls, three chairs, and three beds. In each triplet, the first two are unacceptable in divergent ways (the porridge too hot or too cold, the chairs too large or too soft, etc.) and the third is a happy medium; “just right.”

#### The forms build on one another

Drawn out like this, you can see that each of the three forms of the rule of three is built by layering complexity onto the previous form. The contrasting form takes the sequential element of the progressive form and adds a “right/not right” aspect. The dialectical form takes the "right/not right" aspect of the contrasting form and adds a synthesis element.

## Beyond children's stories

These forms are clear and — perhaps intentionally — obvious in nursery stories and fairy tales. But, their use isn't limited to children’s stories. With a little bit of subtlety and sophistication, they can be used to great effect in stories for all audiences. They appear in many of the great classics.

For example, Charles Dickens’ _A Christmas Carol_ features a progressive rule of three in the ghosts of Christmas that appear to the protagonist.

In Jane Austen’s _Pride and Prejudice_, there’s a powerful example of the contrasting rule of three in Elizabeth’s potential suitors. Collins is socially acceptable but a buffoon, someone who would be intellectual death for Elizabeth to marry. Wickham is attractive and winsome, intellectually interesting, but turns out to be scoundrel and morally repugnant. Only Darcy, whom Elizabeth rejects at first, turns out to (eventually) be everything she can admire and respect.

Because it’s more complex, the dialectical three is a bit harder to see. But it’s there. Many “fish out of water” stories feature a dialectical three where the protagonist must take elements of themselves from both their “ordinary world” and their “magical world” and merge them in a new way to finally undergo the transformation needed to overcome the challenge of the story. Joseph Campbell referred to this as the protagonist becoming “master of the two worlds.” <sup>{% include campbell-2020.html %} Page 247.</sup>

Writer and director Craig Mazin sees this on the thematic level. He describes the dialectical three as the merging of thesis (what the protagonist believed at the story’s beginning) and antithesis (how the story proves that belief wrong) into synthesis (new, thematic knowledge expressed in the climax and resolution). <sup>{% include mazin-2019.html %}</sup>

It seems that Booker would agree with that assessment.

>"'Three' is the final trigger for something important to happen. Three in stories is the number of growth and transformation." <sup>{% include booker-2004.html %} Page 231.</sup>

## Three makes for a good conflict

One last thing to say (today, at least) about the rule of three is that its capacity to establish a trajectory and then pay it off is especially useful when crafting a story's opposition and conflict. Three is the minimum number of story units needed to make a conflict feel satisfying.

If a protagonist tries something one time and succeeds, there doesn’t seem much point in telling a story about it. It must not be very difficult.

If she tries and fails once and then, on the second attempt, succeeds, it likewise makes for a poor story. We grant that there was resistance, yes; but with only one failure and one success, we don’t yet know that the protagonist has learned anything or earned anything. Winning and losing could be pure coincidence. 

But if the protagonist fails twice, we know for certain that failure is not random. A pattern has been established. The thing must be difficult.

Then, when she succeeds, it feels earned. We can cheer for her because we know she has struggled and fought in order to overcome.

"But then," you may ask, “Why not more? What about four or five or six or seven? If two failures make success feel earned, won’t more failures make it feel even _more_ earned?"

In one way, yes. And if your story has enough variation to support a longer series, that’s fine to pursue. 

But it could backfire. Your audience has already gotten the basic pattern at two. Unless additional points of conflict vary the story in a meaningful way, they could feel like they're wasting your audience’s time. What's absolutely necessary is just the three.

## Wrapping things up

There's plenty more to say about the rule of three. It's so basic and so broad in applicability that it shows up nearly everywhere. But it's enough for now to say that it's useful for story structure because it's the most efficient way to set up a trajectory for your audience and then pay it off in a satisfying way.

Onward . . .
