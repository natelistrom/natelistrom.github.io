This post is a part of a mini-series on the rule of three, a story structure primitive.

#### Peak aesthetic experience illustrates how to deliver satisfying payoffs

In a [series of earlier notes]({% post_url 2022-03-29-pae-definitions %}), I explored some of the academic research on what I call peak aesthetic experiences. These are the moments in art, music, and story in which audiences experience chills, tears, a feeling of being moved, or some combination of the three.

For the purposes of our conversation about the rule of three, the most significant point is that peak aesthetic experiences deliver deep and profound satisfaction. By understanding how they do this, we can discover implications for how to deliver satisfaction even in less-than-peak storytelling moments.

#### High tension and quick release maximize a payoff's intensity

Peak aesthetic experiences are constructed by creating a rising tension that reaches a [breakpoint]({% post_url 2022-06-10-pae-breakthrough %}), which elicits surrender and release. <cite>(<a href="pelowski2015">Pelowski</a>, "'Aesthetic'/insightful experience" section)</cite> This surrender can be cognitive or emotional or both. At the moment of release, audiences experience a rush of relief as tension evaporates and they plunge back into a state of equilibrium. <cite>(<a href="pelowski2015">Pelowski</a>, “Emotion” section)</cite> <cite>(<a href="schoeller2016">Schoeller and Perlovsky</a>, “Narratology” section)</cite>

The higher the tension before the breakpoint, and the steeper the fall-off from tension to release (the less time it takes), the more intense will be the experience. <cite>(<a href="schoeller2016">Schoeller and Perlovsky</a>, “Properties of chill-eliciting scenes” section)</cite>

#### The rule of three has this structure built in

Using a setup and payoff structure, the rule of three quite efficiently achieves this build and release of tension.

The trajectory established by the first two beats sets up audience anticipation for where the third beat will go. This anticipation initiates the rising tension. What will the outcome be? Will it be as predicted?

Then, especially if the the third beat subverts the expected trajectory, the audience will experience a breakpoint. 

#### Cognitive dissonance

There comes a brief moment of incompatibility after the third beat. For mere fractions of a second, audience members’ minds wrestle with the difference between the expected and the actual.

Here's a different chart, which illustrates the difference in trajectories of expectation vs. actual:

When our brains recognize the difference between what we expected and what actually occurred, that momentarily increases the tension even more.

Returning to the chart illustrating the ramp of tension, there's a little, additional peak just beyond the third beat:

Recognizing the difference, the audience members’ minds can no longer maintain their previous expectations. In order to incorporate what actually occurs, they must surrender to new knowledge. <cite>(<a href="schoeller2016">Schoeller and Perlovsky</a>, “Review: the two-factor theory of crying” section)</cite> <cite>(<a href="pelowski2015">Pelowski</a>, “Emotion” section)</cite>

Returning to the chart illustrating the trajectories of expectation, we realize that perhaps, all along, the arc that the story was describing was different than what we thought:

Then, as they finally incorporate the new knowledge and update their mental models, tension releases. The audience members experience relief and new equilibrium. <cite>(<a href="schoeller2016">Schoeller and Perlovsky</a>, "Aesthetic chills" section)</cite>

Bracketing is a three-unit story structure following an `A` - `B` - `A` form. It's often used to illustrate transformation by returning to a familiar image, motif, setting, or situation where something has changed because of the intervening story.
