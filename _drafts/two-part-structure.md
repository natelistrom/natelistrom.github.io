Radio personality Ira Glass has articulated what is, probably, the most basic, foundational story structure possible. In a 2009 interview, Glass discussed a two-part method of storytelling, which he described as the combination of an "anecdote" and a "moment of reflection." (Glass) 

- An **anecdote** is a series of events. One thing happened, which led to another, which led to another. (Glass)
- A **moment of reflection** is the "bigger something" that the narrative is all about. (Glass)

Glass points out that a series of events on its own doesn't really make a compelling story. To feel complete, a story needs some kind of resolution. (Glass) 

By implication, the converse is also true. A moment of reflection by itself, without an anecdote to demonstrate it, feels hollow. It’s just a propositional statement. 

To be most effective, the two need each other.

## Glass' formula applies just as well to fiction as nonfiction

Ira Glass derived his formula from nonfiction radio storytelling, but it can apply to fiction just as well. In fact, the form is what author Dwight Swain called a “double-barreled attack” of “pleasurable tension plus ultimate satisfaction.” (Swain, 130) 

The anecdote creates a pleasurable tension as the series of events play out. The moment of reflection pays it off with satisfaction in some kind of resolution.

## Resolution is important for both events and meaning

In Glass' nonfiction, the moment of reflection could be explicit and non-narrative. Literally, "this is what the events taught me." When applied to fiction, the moment of reflection is folded into the narrative itself, being expressed through the story's climax and resolution.

We can think of the moment of reflection on two different levels.

The first is the event level of the story. This is what we typically think of when we think of a story's climax and resolution of a story. It's the events and revelations that happen during final piece of the narrative, which brings everything in the story to a satisfying conclusion. Loose ends are tied up and the characters settle into some kind of new stasis.

The second is the story's _meaning_, which is more directly what Glass meant when he referred to a moment of reflection. The events and revelations of the story, when properly concluded, enable the entire narrative to convey significance.

Reflections on these different levels interact in ways that enrich a story's sense of satisfaction. A good event-based resolution delivers meaning, and a piquant observation about the human experience makes an event-based resolution most satisfying.

## Conclusion

The simplest of structures is two parts: anecdote and reflection. When done well, they deliver for your audience, giving them, in Swain's words, "pleasurable tension plus ultimate satisfaction."
