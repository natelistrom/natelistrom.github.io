## From intuition to craft

Most storytellers already instinctively know how to create meaning in story. It's natural to how we communicate as humans. And, through repeated practice, storytellers hone this intuitive ability.

But intuition can only get you so far. When all your action is intuition-based, outcomes are harder to control. You can create something that works without knowing _why_ it works. Success is harder to reproduce.

As students of craft, we should aim to bring our technique out of the intuitive realm and begin to work on it consciously. Once you know that meaning can be created through comparison, you can use similarities and differences to create intentional effects in your story. 

This intentionality raises your technique out of the intuitive, subconscious realm and allows you to work on it consciously. You can analyze the effects of different "edges" in your story beats and tune specific contrasts in order to create specific, desired effects.
