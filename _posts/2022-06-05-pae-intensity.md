I'm doing research for a book about story. [I'm posting summaries of my notes as I go.]({% post_url 2022-03-21-public-research %}) This forces me to ["work with the garage door up."](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up) In this post, I continue exploring research on [peak aesthetic experiences]({% post_url 2022-03-29-pae-definitions %}).

What causes peak aesthetic experiences? In earlier posts, I talked about some elements of story content that contribute to peak aesthetic experiences. Among them are:

- [Investment]({% post_url 2022-04-05-pae-investment %})
- Content ([1]({% post_url 2022-04-08-pae-content %}), [2]({% post_url 2022-05-09-pae-content-2 %}), [3]({% post_url 2022-05-22-pae-content-3 %}), [4]({% post_url 2022-05-25-pae-content-4 %}))
- [Expectation]({% post_url 2022-04-15-pae-expectation %})

In this post, I’ll talk about another element that can help elicit peak aesthetic experiences: intensity.

In his paper, Matthew Pelowski cites an encounter by performance artist [Andrea Fraser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Fraser) with the work of sculptor [Fred Sandback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Sandback):

> &ldquo;[Fraser] recalled feeling that [Sandback's] works were so devoid of substance that they led her to question the ontological viability of art, causing a subsequent questioning of art making, and—because she was herself an artist—causing a re-evaluation of herself." <sup>{% include pelowski-2015.html %} "The two-factor theory and examples with art" section.</sup>

> &ldquo;'For me, art [became] an impossibility. And if art is impossible, then artists are also impossible, and I myself am impossible.'" <sup>{% include pelowski-2015.html %} "The two-factor theory and examples with art" section.</sup>

Confronted by Sandback's work, Fraser had something of a moment. She experienced a challenge to her core identity and was moved to tears as a result. <sup>{% include pelowski-2015.html %} "The two-factor theory and examples with art" section.</sup> 

Her encounter can teach us about peak aesthetic experience.

## Tension and schema change

In Matthew Pelowski's theory, people are moved to tears through a multi-step process: 

1. First, people encounter a "discrepancy between expectation and perception." <sup>{% include pelowski-2015.html %} "Review: the two-factor theory of crying" section.</sup> (See post on the [knowledge instinct]({% post_url 2022-04-15-pae-expectation %}).) 
2. This is followed by a "period of tension or anxiety in which individuals search for resolution or try to repress discrepancy's consequence." <sup>{% include pelowski-2015.html %} "Review: the two-factor theory of crying" section.</sup> (See post on [incongruity]({% post_url 2022-05-22-pae-content-3 %}).) 
3. Finally, if people cannot find a way to escape, there is a watershed moment (in more senses than one) in which people's schema's readjust. <sup>{% include pelowski-2015.html %} "Review: the two-factor theory of crying" section.</sup>

Pelowski's theory focuses on _schema change_, a moment when a person's model of the world has been challenged and they can no longer maintain their previous understanding.

Generally, these moments involve resistance. People will, if given a chance, choose to preserve their existing schemas.

> &ldquo;Individuals typically structure interactions to avoid . . . discrepant events, employing pre-expectational filters, or, if discrepancy arises, attempting to diminish or escape from involvement." <sup>{% include pelowski-2015.html %} "Review: the two-factor theory of crying" section.</sup>

This makes sense if you think about it. Updating our models of the world takes energy, <sup>{% include schoellerAndPerlovsky-2016.html %} "Conclusion" section.</sup> and, as neuroscientist Read Montague discusses at length in _Your Brain Is (Almost) Perfect_, our brains are wired to conserve energy. <sup>{% include montague-2006.html %} Pages 22-24.</sup> Given a choice, we will choose to conserve energy.

This resistance to schema change manifests as Pelowski's "period of tension or anxiety."

Our experience of tension is, in large part, the subjective experience of our brains' resistance to change that it either anticipates or has already detected.

## Intensity, significance, and physiological response

"That's all well and good," you may say, "But, humans encounter hundreds of discrepancies every day, yet almost all of them fail to result in strong emotion, let alone _peak_ experience. What makes the difference?"

It's a great question.

It appears that most differences don't result in peak experiences because they simply aren't significant enough. They are either of so little degree or so little consequence that they don't matter. 
It's only when there's a significant schema change, when a deeply-held schema is threatened, that we experience the tension necessary to elicit peak aesthetic experience. Peak aesthetic experience is, at least in part, related to the _degree of intensity_ of the threat to our schemas.

Study participants' physiological responses support this claim.

For example, when measuring participants' experience of chills elicited by music, Blood and Zatorre observed significant increases in heart rate, breathing, and electromyogram (EMG) readings (EMG can be used to gauge muscle tension). <sup>{% include bloodAndZatorre-2001.html %} "Results" section</sup> Wassiliwizky et al. also observed increase in heart rate related to tears and goosebumps. <sup>{% include wassiliwizky-2017.html %} "Discussion" section</sup> Mori an Iwanaga observed increased heart rate and respiration depth in response to peak moments in music listening. <sup>{% include moriAndIwanaga-2017.html %} "Discussion" section</sup>

Blood and Zatorre found that, "as intensity of . . . chills increased, cerebral blood flow increases and decreases were observed in brain regions thought to be involved in reward/motivation, emotion, and arousal . . . brain structures are known to be active in response to other euphoria-inducing stimuli, such as food, sex, and drugs of abuse." <sup>{% include bloodAndZatorre-2001.html %} "Abstract" section</sup>

Participants' reports of their subjective experiences seem to agree with the physiological findings.
For example, Schoeller and Perlovsky found that, among their participants, the emotional payoff reported at story climax and resolution appeared to be proportional to the intensity of the preceding struggle. The greater the struggle, the greater the payoff. <sup>{% include schoellerAndPerlovsky-2016.html %} "Properties of chill-eliciting scenes" section</sup> 

Thus, participants' subjective sensation of peak aesthetic experience correlated with physiological responses that also correlate with intensity.

## The intensity threshold

There appears to be a minimum level of intensity required in order to elicit peak aesthetic experience.

Blood and Zatorre observed that responses to music in participants' neural reward centers "were found to correlate with chills intensity _but not_ with the more mildly pleasant emotion associated with consonance.” <sup>{% include bloodAndZatorre-2001.html %} "Discussion" section</sup> (Emphasis mine.)

This demonstrates that peak physiological responses were activated by a certain level of intensity, rather than just listening to music in general.

Furthermore, their study participants reported that the intensity of their chills trailed behind the intensity they experienced for pleasantness and emotional intensity. <sup>{% include bloodAndZatorre-2001.html %} "Results" section</sup>

In other words, chills intensity correlated with pleasantness and emotional intensity — they rose and fell at the same times — but chills intensity was always less intense than those other feelings. According to the researchers, this suggests that "pleasantness and emotional intensity <em>must reach a certain level</em> before chills are experienced." <sup>{% include bloodAndZatorre-2001.html %} "Results" section</sup> (Emphasis mine.)

## Intensity and storytelling

What does this all mean for storytellers?

Clearly, when it comes to crafting a peak aesthetic experience, tension is a good thing. The more intense the moment immediately before breakthrough, the more likely to result in peak aesthetic experience for the audience. <sup class="aside">A</sup> <sup class="aside">B</sup>

<aside>
A. There's an interesting contrast between the shape of the ideal curve for intensity, which appears to just go up and up, and the ideal curve for <a href="{% post_url 2022-05-09-pae-content-2 %}">optimal difference</a>, which has a peak in the middle and diminishes on both sides.
</aside>

<aside>
B. Tension and intensity in this context are not necessarily related to intense action. A compelling personal drama can have as much intensity as an action thriller or even more. In fact, based on what we've seen earlier about <a href="{% post_url 2022-04-08-pae-content %}">various content elements</a> that contribute to peak aesthetic experience, it seems that intense character drama is much more likely than intense action to create the environment in which peak aesthetic experience can happen. The more personal, the better. (Think of how personal was the experience of the artist Andrea Fraser, who I mentioned at the beginning of this post. Her encounter with Sandback was on the level of identity. It's hard to get more personal than that.)
</aside>

Furthermore, we can begin to see how these moments are constructed on a mechanical level.
In an [earlier post]({% post_url 2022-04-15-pae-expectation %}), I mentioned Schoeller and Perlovsky's "tension principle," the idea that a storyteller sets up a dramatic situation or question but withholds crucial details that would fill in the answer. Thanks to Pelowski, we can see that this "unanswered question" creates tension because it causes our brains to anticipate possible schema change.

Let's put this all together.

First, a storyteller creates an initial schema in the audience's mind. To do this, the storyteller must help the audience [invest]({% post_url 2022-04-05-pae-investment %}) in the protagonist and the protagonist's goal. <sup class="aside">C</sup> It's even more powerful if the protagonist's situation somehow relates to [values]({% post_url 2022-04-05-pae-investment %}) that resonate with the audience. 

<aside>
C. I'm using "goal" here to refer to both what the protagonist actively desires and what the audience senses they need, which may be different things. Both involve audience investment, but in stories, protagonist needs seem (to me) to be more deeply felt by audiences. Thus, they are more important from the perspective of schema change and peak aesthetic experience. In Pixar's <em>Finding Nemo</em>, for example, though most people would probably say the story is about Marlin's quest to find his son, Nemo (goal), the thing that they respond to most deeply is Marlin's journey to becoming a better father (need).
</aside>

After firmly establishing the schema, the storyteller then threatens that schema, creating the possibility that it will need to change. This creates tension. The more deeply invested the audience is in the protagonist and the goal, the more deeply felt will be the tension over schema change.

> &ldquo;If the story is well-crafted (if the classical unities are respected, if the elements of the narrative are important, if the viewer cares about the story) narrative tension should trigger psychological tension (i.e., an emotional response)." <sup>{% include schoellerAndPerlovsky-2016.html %} "Narratology" section</sup>

One key insight here is that tension is now embodied in goals and obstacles.

> &ldquo;There exist mainly two types of heroes: (i) heroes who have tremendous goals (e.g., being the best chest player in the world) and (ii) heroes who have tremendous obstacles (e.g., surviving a natural catastrophe).” <sup>{% include schoellerAndPerlovsky-2016.html %} "Narratology" section</sup>

If written in a formula, we could say:

- `Investment in the characters and their goals` = `Schema 1`
- `Obstacles` = `Schema 2`
- `Schema 1` + `Schema 2` = `Tension`

Thus:

- `Investment in characters and their goals` + `Obstacles` = `Tension`

Over the course of the narrative, the storyteller raises the tension by increasing the value of the goals or the strength of the obstacles. At the climax, the tension is resolved either positively or negatively, and the audience's schema for the story rebalances.

Schoeller and Perlovsky express a formula for thus:

> &ldquo;Narrative tension is directly proportional to conflict, and it is inversely proportional to the likelihood of the hero reaching his goal given obstacles.” <sup>{% include schoellerAndPerlovsky-2016.html %} "Narratology" section</sup>

## Conclusion

In sum:

- There's a compelling case that the threat of schema change is the source of narrative tension. The intensity of that tension is related to the significance of the schema change. 
- When audiences are more deeply invested in the characters and their goals, the _significance_ of the schema increases. When the obstacles become greater, the _threat_ to the schema increases. 
- So, as audience investment in characters and goals increases, and as the strength of obstacles increases, so does the tension the audience feels over the anticipated schema change. 
- And finally, tension must reach a certain minimum level of intensity before peak aesthetic experience is possible.
