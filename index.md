ðŸ‘‹ Hi there.

I'm a multi-disciplinary creative living in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.

I've been drawing since I was a child, fiddling around with `HTML` and `CSS` since 2003, and doing design professionally since 2008.

My work includes product design and web design, illustration, logo design and branding, print design, and a (very) little bit of video.

When I'm not drawing pictures, I like to learn about stories and how they work.
