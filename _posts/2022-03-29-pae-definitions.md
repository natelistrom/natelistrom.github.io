I’m doing research for a book I hope to write. The book is about story, with a focus on story structure and the underlying functions that make it work. As part of my research, I’m interested in the neuroscience behind storytelling.

As part of my process, [I'm posting summaries of my notes as I go.]({% post_url 2022-03-21-public-research %}) This forces me to "learn in public," abandoning my perfectionist tendencies and, hopefully, benefitting you.

One of the neuroscience topics I'm researching is what I'm calling "peak aesthetic experiences." <sup class="aside">A</sup> <sup class="aside">B</sup>

<aside>
A. Mori and Iwanaga call these &ldquo;peak emotional experiences.&rdquo; <sup>{% include moriAndIwanaga-2017.html %}</sup>

<br /><br />However, I'm not sure that these accurately cover all forms of peak emotional experiences. Experiencing chills and tears doesn't necessarily account for experiences of extreme rage, for example. (Although, perhaps peak rage is when a person is so angry as to be moved to tears, so maybe the label is accurate. Needs more research.)

<br /><br />In any case, since the focus here is on peak emotional experiences related to art, beauty, and story, I'm substituting &ldquo;emotional&rdquo; with &ldquo;aesthetic.
</aside>

<aside>B. I discovered the topic of peak aesthetic experiences by accident. I was looking for research on build and release of tension, something that I hypothesize is at the core of our experience as a story audience. In the process, I've found a bunch of research on adjacent topics, which, joined together, start to paint a picture. Peak aesthetic experiences are part of that picture.</aside>

A peak aesthetic experience is one in which a person is exposed to a particularly meaningful work of art, music, nature, or story and experiences tears, chills, a sense of being moved, or some combination of these. Subjectively, a person may feel pleasure, intensity, or insight. People generally look back on peak aesthetic experiences as profoundly positive. For storytellers, peak aesthetic experiences are especially important because of the [peak-end rule](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/peak-end-rule/).

You can think of peak aesthetic experiences as the kind of emotional reaction that a person has to an especially meaningful work of art, music, or story.

## Chills, tears, being moved

In the scientific literature, there are at least three phenomena associated with peak aesthetic experiences: 

- chills
- tears
- a feeling of “being moved”

These phenomena are, in some ways distinct. For example, using music as a prompt, Mori and Iwanaga found that chills are associated with states of arousal, while tears are associated with calm. <sup>{% include moriAndIwanaga-2017.html %}</sup>

Nevertheless, in peak experiences, these phenomena overlap in interesting ways.

In the same studies, Mori and Iwanaga found that both tears and chills produced pleasure and deep breathing. <sup>{% include moriAndIwanaga-2017.html %}</sup> Both have also been reported to co-occur with states of being moved. <sup>{% include menninghaus-2015.html %}</sup> <sup>{% include wassiliwizky-2017.html %}</sup> 

And, although they create opposite states of arousal, chills and tears even can overlap. <sup>{% include moriAndIwanaga-2017.html %}</sup> In fact, Wassiliwizky et al. found that the intensity of response is strongest when they do. “The overlap of tears and goosebumps signifies a maximal climax within peak moments.” <sup>{% include wassiliwizky-2017.html %}</sup> 

It’s not unrealistic to thus conclude that all three might happen at the same peak event. Engaging with a particularly salient stimulus, a person may have near simultaneous chills, tears, and a sense of being moved. This is peak aesthetic experience.

## Quick facts about peak aesthetic experiences

I'll go into all of this more later, but for now, here's a rapid-fire summary of facts about peak aesthetic experiences:

- Peak aesthetic experiences are cross-cultural <sup>{% include wassiliwizky-2017.html %}</sup> <sup>{% include menninghaus-2015.html %}</sup> <sup>{% include pelowski-2015.html %}</sup>, suggesting that they're core human responses, rather than socially or environmentally adapted.
- They're pleasurable, activating the same parts of the brain as euphoric experiences. <sup>{% include bloodAndZatorre-2001.html %}</sup> <sup>{% include moriAndIwanaga-2017.html %}</sup>
- They're intense. <sup>{% include menninghaus-2015.html %}</sup> (I know, "Thank you, captain obvious.")
- They can give us a feeling of insight, a "eureka moment." <sup>{% include pelowski-2015.html %}</sup> <sup>{% include schoellerAndPerlovsky-2016.html %}</sup>
- Tears, at least, can be cathartic. <sup>{% include moriAndIwanaga-2017.html %}</sup>
- They results in positive evaluations of the elicitor. People like a moving story and rate it highly. <sup>{% include pelowski-2015.html %}</sup>

## Diving deeper

In the rest of the series, I expand on what the research says about how people experience these moments and what, for storytellers, might go into creating them for an audience.
