<p class="dropCap">Your brain's reward system is a complex set of interacting elements. It uses a neurotransmitter called dopamine to send coded signals that influence your behavior, causing you to seek rewards and avoid punishments. Dopamine also affects things like your focus, memory, and experience of pleasure.</p>

At base, your reward system is designed to help you survive. It's a core element in your ability to learn new information, helping you differentiate things that have positive effects (like food) and things that you need to avoid. <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#schultz2015">Schultz</a>, "B. Distal Reward Function is Evolutionary Fitness" section)</cite> 


## Common currency
There's a bit of wonderful magic in the fact that the same reward functions that help us value and prioritize basic things like food can also help us value and prioritize more complex goods:

> "Nonprimary rewards can be physical, tangible objects like money, sleek cars, or expensive jewelry, or material liquids like a glass of wine, or particular ingredients like spices or alcohol. They can have particular pleasant sensory properties like the visual features of a Japanese garden or a gorgeous sunset, the acoustic beauty of Keith Jarrett's Cologne Concert, the warm feeling of water in the Caribbean, the gorgeous taste of a gourmet dinner, or the irresistible odor of a perfume.” <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#schultz2015">Schultz</a>, "C. Types of Rewards" section)</cite>

Even abstract goods like the experience of love, honor, achievement, etc. are valuated by the same underlying hardware. Both love and a hamburger are mediated by the same "common currency" of reward signals. <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#berridge2015">Berridge and Kringelbach</a>, "Mapping pleasure in the brain" section)</cite> 

This is why, for example, a parent to choose to forego eating a meal so that their children can eat instead. Both the meal and caring for the child are valuated using the same "currency," and the child weighs more in the equation. <sup class="aside">A</sup>

<aside>
A. &ldquo;Common currency&rdquo; thus perhaps explains why even though the more basic needs in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy</a> are often prioritized first, people <em>can</em> choose to prioritize more abstract needs over more basic ones.

## Dopamine for wanting vs. liking or memory

"Our review of the literature, together with results of a new study of residual reward capacity after dopamine depletion, indicates the answer to both questions is 'no'. Rather, dopamine systems may mediate the incentive salience of rewards, modulating their motivational value in a manner separable from hedonia and reward learning. In a study of the consequences of dopamine loss, rats were depleted of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum by up to 99% using 6-hydroxydopamine. In a series of experiments, we applied the `taste reactivity' measure of affective reactions (gapes, etc.) to assess the capacity of dopamine-depleted rats for: 1) normal affect (hedonic and aversive reactions), 2) modulation of hedonic affect by associative learning (taste aversion conditioning), and 3) hedonic enhancement of affect by non-dopaminergic pharmacological manipulation of palatability (benzodiazepine administration). We found normal hedonic reaction patterns to sucrose vs. quinine, normal learning of new hedonic stimulus values (a change in palatability based on predictive relations), and normal pharmacological hedonic enhancement of palatability."

## Rewards help us learn
As you navigate and experience the world, your brain creates new, more complex or abstract rewards: 

> “By itself a red apple is an object without any intrinsic meaning. However, after having experienced its nutritious and pleasantly tasting contents, the apple with its shape and color has become a reinforcer in its own right. As a higher order, conditioned reward, the apple serves all the defining functions of rewards, namely, learning, approach behavior, and pleasure . . . _[Even] seeing the delicious apple evokes a pleasant feeling._” <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#schultz2015">Schultz</a>, "A. Principles of Reward Learning" section)</cite> (Emphasis mine.)

The original reward of eating a crunchy, juicy apple transfers such that you experience a reward even when you just see a good looking apple.

This phenomenon underlies much of how we learn.


> “Once a stimulus has been Pavlovian conditioned, it confers information about the reward . . . I have learned that a particular sign on a building indicates a pub because I have experienced the beer inside. The atmosphere and the beer represent a value to me that is assigned in a Pavlovian manner to the pub sign.” <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#schultz2015">Schultz</a>, "A. Principles of Reward Learning" section)</cite>


#### Montague and monkeys: conditioned reward and diminishing returns

In his book, _Your Brain is (Almost) Perfect_, neuroscientist Read Montague describes the process as it was first discovered in researcher Wolfram Schultz's experiments with monkeys. Schultz set up a situation such that first a light shone (a signal) and then, a short time later, the monkeys received a squirt of juice (a basic reward). <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#montague2006">Montague</a>, Page 113)</cite>

> "When the light is initially presented, there is no change in dopamine neuron activity . . . However, the arrival of the juice a short time later causes a burst of activity in the dopamine neurons.” <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#montague2006">Montague</a>, Page 113)</cite>

The monkeys didn’t know what to expect when they saw the flashing light, so, when they received the juice, their reward systems triggered a dopamine response that told their brains, “Wow! Something better than expected just happened!” <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#montague2006">Montague</a>, Page 113)</cite>

Over time, though, things changed. The monkeys' reward systems learned the connection between the flashing light and the arrival of the juice. The firing of the dopamine neurons shifted from the arrival of the juice to _earlier_ in the sequence, when the light first shone:

> “The neurons now report that the light is ‘better than expected’; that is, they react to the light _in the same fashion_ that they reacted initially to the juice.” <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#montague2006">Montague</a>, Page 113)</cite> (Emphasis mine.)



#### Conditioned vs. intrinsic rewards

The same paradigm is at play in both the examples of the shiny red apple and the lights and the juice. By transferring its reward response in this way, your brain can learn higher-order rewards from more basic ones.

But that's not the only way your brain works with rewards. Some rewards are intrinsic. That is, they exist independent of extrinsic motivations like food for survival. 

> "Intrinsic rewards are genuine rewards in their own right . . . like perfectioning, playing, and enjoying the piano. Although they can serve to condition higher order rewards, they are not conditioned, higher order rewards, as attaining their reward properties does not require pairing with an unconditioned reward." <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#schultz2015">Schultz</a>, "C. Types of rewards" section)</cite>

These intrinsic rewards mean that your experience of joy and pleasure comes from more than just the mere nuts and bolts of survival.

> "Intrinsic rewards are activities that are pleasurable on their own and are undertaken for their own sake, without being the means for getting extrinsic rewards. We may even generate our own rewards through internal decisions. Mice in the wild enter wheels and run on them on repeated occasions without receiving any other reward or benefit, like the proverbial wheel running hamster. Movements produce proprioceptive stimulation in muscle spindles and joint receptors, touch stimulation on the body surface, and visual stimulation from seeing the movement, all of which can be perceived as pleasurable and thus have reward functions.” <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#schultz2015">Schultz</a>, "C. Types of rewards" section)</cite>

But:

> "Jokes, suspense, poems, and relaxation may induce changes of viewpoints and thus help to understand the world, which may help us to consider alternative food sources and mating partners, which is helpful when old sources dry up. Although these rewards act indirectly, they increase evolutionary fitness by enhancing the functions of primary alimentary and reproductive rewards." <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#schultz2015">Schultz</a>, "C. Types of rewards" section)</cite>

So basically, Schultz argues that there are primary rewards, which are directly connected with survival and secondary rewards, which are not. Among secondary rewards there are those that are directly conditioned (like the appearance of an apple being conditioned based on our experience of eating apples) and those that are not (like the pleasure we derive from listening to music). But in every case, Schultz theorizes that the rewards convey some kind of adaptive advantage.

> "The added advantage of intrinsic over solely extrinsic rewards is their lack of narrow focus on tangible results, which helps to develop a larger spectrum of skills that can be used for solving wider ranges of problems." <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#schultz2015">Schultz</a>, "C. Types of rewards" section)</cite>

In fact, it appears that the reward system is specially tuned to help us learn. Two phenomenon underscore this claim.

First, research has shown that reward signals in your brain focus your attention. <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#schultz2015">Schultz</a>, "A. Principles of Reward Learning" section)</cite> The more salient a reward, the more attention it commands. <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#schultz2015">Schultz</a>, "E. Reward and Free Will" section)</cite> This added focus aids learning.

A 2013 study demonstrated that attention warps our mental representations of the world, artificially amplifying what we are focusing on and supressing everything else. <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#cukur2013">Çukur</a>)</cite>

Second, reward signals directly enhance your brain's ability to code new memories. (See: https://workflowy.com/#/89e3aec48b11, especially: https://workflowy.com/#/1cd15208543e)

“Numerous studies have reported that the amygdala and hippocampus are synergistically activated during memory encoding to form a LTM of emotional information, that is associated with better retention (McGaugh et al., 1996; Richter-Levin and Akirav, 2000; Richardson et al., 2004). More importantly, these studies (fear-related learning) strongly suggest that the amygdala’s involvement in emotional processing strengthens the memory network by modulating memory consolidation; thus, emotional content is remembered better than neutral content.”

“Activation of the amygdala during the encoding of emotionally arousing information (both pleasant/unpleasant) has been reported that correlates with subsequent recall.”

#### Pleasure from anticipation of aesthetic experience

This is tremendously significant for storytellers for two reasons: 

First, it suggests that, independent of factors within the thing itself, your brain may create rewards associated with the simple anticipation of an aesthetic experience. 

There's a type of pleasant expectation you feel when sitting down to watch a movie or read a book that you know is going to be good. That feeling stands on its own even without yet experiencing the story. As the shape and appearance of the apple are rewarding before the first bite, so the _promise_ of a good story can be pleasurable in its own right.

Second, it suggests that _types_ of story experiences can become coded as rewards. This might be something behind our experience of genre, like romance, heist, adventure, mystery, and all the rest.

And of course, the same thing can apply to individual moments within stories just as well as with stories as a whole. 


## Pleasure

Pleasure is a sort of natural encouragement for behaviors that help us survive. Our subjective experience of pleasure helps reinforce survival-related actions.

> "The brain was not made for enjoying a great meal; it was made for getting the best food for survival, and one of the ways to do that is to make sure that people are attentive and appreciate what they are eating." <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#schultz2015">Schultz</a>, "B. Distal Reward Function is Evolutionary Fitness" section)</cite>
