Epistemic status is a representation of my level of investment in an idea. It comes from the concept of [digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and is a mixture of the amount of time I've invested in an idea and my level of confidence in that idea.

#### Scribble
An idea I'm just playing around with. I probably havent invested much time in the idea, and I'm not confident in my conclusions.

- Low confidence
- Low effort

#### Note
More mature than a scribble, but not yet what digital gardener Maggie Appleton calls an "evergreen" idea. A note may have taken a fair amount of time to develop. I think the idea has merit.

- Moderate confidence
- Low, moderate, or high effort

#### Essay
These are the ideas I'm proud of. Although my writing here may still have rough bits and need occasional pruning, these are the ones I feel have "stood the test of time." 

- High confidence
- Moderate or high effort
