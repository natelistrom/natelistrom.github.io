I'm doing research for a book about story. [I'm posting summaries of my notes as I go.]({% post_url 2022-03-21-public-research %}) This forces me to "learn in public."

In this post, I continue exploring the research on [peak aesthetic experiences]({% post_url 2022-03-29-pae-definitions %}).

What causes peak aesthetic experiences? In an [earlier post]({% post_url 2022-04-05-pae-investment %}), I talked about what I labeled "investment," the audience's connection to the characters and themes in a story. 

In this post, I'll talk about four key aspects of story _content_, which contribute to peak aesthetic experiences:

- Resonance with values
- Relationship change
- Prosocial actions
- Mixed valence

## Resonance with values

Our values are our ethical and moral center. They determine how we assign importance, how we define something as 'good' or 'bad,' and how we appraise ourselves and others.

In the [previous post]({% post_url 2022-04-05-pae-investment %}), I talked about how stories that meaningfully hook into our core values affect us more deeply than those that don't. We're more deeply invested in these stories, and thus they affect us more powerfully.

But, when it comes to peak aesthetic experiences, it's a particular subset of values that have the most impact.

Menninghaus et al. suggest that, based on their surveys, peak aesthetic experiences have a "fairly circumscribed focus on prosocial norms and self-ideals." They are, "limited to affiliative types of social bonding, \[which\] range from feelings of attachment to family and friends to similar feelings towards larger and more abstract social entities, such as one’s country or social and religious communities.” <sup>{% include menninghaus-2015.html %}</sup>

In other words, the most significant values are those connected to relationships. <sup class="aside">A</sup>

<aside>
A. There are some counterexamples in which peak aesthetic experience doesn't result from social values. Response to natural beauty is, for example, asocial by definition. Another possible counterexample comes from an account cited by Pelowski in which an artist, upon trying to understand a postmodern work and being defeated by its meaninglessness, felt her own identity challenged to the point of being moved. <sup>{% include pelowski-2015.html %}</sup>
</aside>

## Relationship change

There's a strong thread in the research suggesting that observing (and, perhaps, vicariously experiencing) social interactions is one of the main elicitors of peak aesthetic emotions.

For example, In a 2017 experiment, Wassiliwizky et al. asked twenty five participants to provide examples of movie scenes that had moved them to tears in the past. Out of the resulting one hundred and thirty-seven clips, nearly 94% focused on social interactions. And, when they identified the genres of the movies from which these clips came, more than 94% of them were from genres that could be categorized as social (Drama 39%, Romance 19%, Comedy 8%, Biography 5%). <sup>{% include wassiliwizky-2017.html %}</sup>

In Menninghaus et al.'s 2015 interview of more than two hundred students, the majority of participants chose to report "moving" events that were "significant relationship events and critical life events (especially death, birth, marriage, separation, and reunion).” <sup>{% include menninghaus-2015.html %}</sup>

In 2016, Schoeller and Perlovsky interviewed sixty students, asking them to describe scenes in films, books, or plays, which gave them chills. They found that, again, relationships and, especially, _changes_ in relationships were significant.

> "Chill-eliciting scenes usually involve radical changes in the _relations_ among characters; e.g., separation through death or reunion after strong and demanding efforts." (Emphasis theirs.) <sup>{% include schoellerAndPerlovsky-2016.html %}</sup>

This dynamic element appears to be important. It's not enough for a story to simply be _about_ relationships or social interactions. Those relationships must have some significant moment of change.

## Prosocial actions

Bring the two things together &mdash; social relationships and resonance with values and beliefs &mdash; and we get a synthesis: selfless action on behalf of others.

Wassiliwizky et al. and Menninghaus et al. both confirm that depictions of prosocial behavior factored significantly in their study results. <sup class="aside">B</sup> <sup>{% include menninghaus-2015.html %}</sup> <sup>{% include wassiliwizky-2017.html %}</sup>

<aside>
B. The word "depictions" is important here. Menninghaus et al. observe that audiences can actually be turned off by stories that are too direct in their preachiness. <sup>{% include menninghaus-2015.html %}</sup> This is an area in which the old adage, “show, don’t tell,” is especially important. We’ll be deeply moved by watching a hero sacrifice for others, wishing that we had the moral strength to behave similarly. But, we’ll throw a book across the room if it literally comes out and tells us to live that way.
</aside>

> "We found that displays of prosocial behavior play a crucial role in the elicitation of tears and goosebumps." <sup>{% include wassiliwizky-2017.html %}</sup>

Especially important in this mix is self-denial. <sup>{% include schoellerAndPerlovsky-2016.html %}</sup> <sup>{% include wassiliwizky-2017.html %}</sup> When characters choose willingly to perform acts on behalf of others, at significant cost to themselves, it's deeply moving.

> "Chills are . . . experienced when characters are no longer acting for their own sake but for a cause greater than themselves . . . when the values driving a given action are stronger than the likelihood for this action being successful." <sup>{% include schoellerAndPerlovsky-2016.html %}</sup>

In story, the power of these moments of selflessness often comes by combining _values_ with a _change in the relationships_ between characters. 

For example, think of Mr. Darcy's second proposal to Elizabeth in the climax of Jane Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_. Darcy demonstrates altruism (values, self-denial) by expressing willingness to be denied. He is no longer caring only about his own desires; now, he cares about hers as well. In so doing, he demonstrates his change of heart toward Elizabeth (relationship change) who then is able to show how she has changed as well and receive him.

## Mixed valence

The last of our four content elements, which contributes to peak aesthetic experiences, is valence.

Valence is a term used in the literature to talk about positive and negative feeling.

The evidence seems to suggest that _mixed_ valence &mdash; experiencing both positive and negative feelings at the same time &mdash; is important for "being moved."

For example, Menninghaus et al. found that "Both the sad and the joyful variants of being moved showed a coactivation of positive and negative affect." <sup>{% include menninghaus-2015.html %}</sup>

In other words, moving events that were sad had a happy component to them, and moving events that were happy were tinged with sadness.

Wassiliwizky et al. similarly suggest that "the mixture of a predominant emotional component, for example, sadness, _with its emotional antidote_ is an essential requirement for states of being moved to occur.” <sup>{% include wassiliwizky-2017.html %}</sup> (Emphasis mine.)

Mori and Iwanaga found that their study was consistent with similar conclusions from a meta-analysis of mixed emotions. In their results, chills were present with "simultaneous pleasure, happiness, and sadness." <sup>{% include moriAndIwanaga-2017.html %}</sup>

What do these mixed valence events look like? Wassiliwizky et al. elaborate:

> "In a farewell scenario, for instance, the predominant emotion of sadness is mixed with positive feelings of social bonding . . . Conversely . . . the predominant building block of joy &mdash; elicited, for instance, in a reunion scene &mdash; is balanced by a negative antidote, that is, reactivated feelings of the preceding painful separation." <sup>{% include wassiliwizky-2017.html %}</sup>

Or, take Menninghaus et al.'s example:

> "Funerals, while deeply sad, also commemorate and honor the deceased person; moreover, they revitalize social and affective bonds among the survivors. Similarly, a reunion after a long separation, while deeply joyful, can also bring up reminiscences of the uncertainties and feelings of separation experienced in the meantime." <sup>{% include menninghaus-2015.html %}</sup>

Wassiliwizky and Menninghaus are coauthors, so it's not surprising that they would use reunions here as a common example. It's a good one, though, and may be suggestive for stoytellers.

Perhaps part of the success of good story climaxes and resolutions is that they evoke mixed feelings by the contrast developed between the negative situation created by the central story conflict and the positive situation created by its satisfying resolution. 

This could be just as true for "tragic" stories as for those with happy endings. Even if the protagonist makes choices that ultimately lead to their defeat and punishment, if the audience views that ending as satisfying (perhaps inline with their values), it can be experienced as a positive resolution to the negative tension created by the story's conflict.

## Conclusion

In sum, there appear to be a handful of elements in the content of stories that can elicit peak emotional responses. Among them are a resonance with the audience's core values; moments of significant change in character relationships; demonstrations of self-sacrificial, prosocial behavior; and a mixture of both positive and negative feelings.

Admittedly, this list isn't particularly ground-breaking. These four elements, or some subset of them, are common to almost all stories. But, it's nice to have a storyteller's intuition backed and grounded by the research.

These also aren't a checklist, silver bullet, or recipe to follow blindly. Simply including these elements doesn't guarrantee that an audience will experience peak aesthetic emotion. There's still a lot to be said for the individual craft and specific execution of the storyteller.

But these things are good to keep in mind as you think about crafting stories. With which values does your theme and character actions resonate? Which relationships change, and how do they change? Do your characters act on behalf of others in significant moments of change, at a cost to themselves? Are moments of triumph tinged with loss or moments of resolution tinted with the conflict that came before?

Onward . . .
