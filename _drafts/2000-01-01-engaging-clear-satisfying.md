<p class="dropCap">A well-designed chair is ergonomic. It&rsquo;s fitted, the right height and depth. It supports a person&rsquo;s back and encourages good posture. A good piece of writing should do the same, but for a mind instead of a body.</p>

I've found it useful to think of the "ergonomics" of storytelling in four categories. Stories that satisfy us do so because they [fit our human shape]({% post_url 2022-12-01-human-factors %}). They're clear, engaging, affecting, and meaningful. 

Writing that's unclear will struggle to engage you. Writing that's not engaging will fail to make you feel emotion. And writing that doesn't move you in some way cannot change you.

## Clear

- Perhaps make this more about _fluency_ than clarity. The idea is that the tools of this section remove obstacles to your audience's receipt of the ideas of the story.

- Language - grammar, spelling, sentence and paragraph length and directness, prose style

#### How we understand ideas
- Concreteness/reification - give the audience handholds with which to grasp the story
- Specificity - Universal through the specific. Part of concreteness?
- Structure

#### How we get a sense for the "rightness" of the story material
Is this more for the engaging step or the clarity step? Maybe perspective is for engaging?

- Causality and believability

> "In every scene you write, the protagonist must react in a way the reader can see and understand in the moment. This reaction must be specific, personal, and have an effect on whether the protagonist achieves her goal." (Cron, Page 47)

- Positioning, location, wayfinding - help your audience understand where they are and get a sense of progress and direction. Are we moving or standing still? In which direction are we moging? How do we know when we've arrived?
- Focus - Make sure that everything that needs to be present is there, and trim out everything extraneous. (And this from the perspective of your audience. It doesn't matter if something *technically* needs to be there. It matters if your audience feels or understands why it needs to be there. Story about designing user experience versus shipping the implementation.) 

- Perspective - Not sure quite where to put this. This is a bit different than identification, though they overlap. Perspective is about how well-fitted the story is to the audience. (So it may have some overlap with the meaning section as well, since the audience's context works together with the story to create meaning.) Within the bounds of perspective are things like Hall's points. Also things like the fact that the morality of the story needs to resonate with the morality of the audience.

> "It might be tempting to share your feelings about the product or the opportunity, but the only emotions that matter in the value story are those of your potential customer and, as such, the identifiable character." (Hall, Page 73)

> "The issue is never the event itself; never what happens. A thing matters only insofar as it relates to and affects and is judged by people." (Swain, 38)

> "In the case of our rainstorm, are we to view it through the eyes and feelings of carnival owner or farmer?" (Swain, 38)

Perspective is important because it gives the audience a way to evaluate the things in the story. Reification helps to know what a thing is — a puppy swimming in a river — perspective helps interpret — the river is heading toward a waterfall.

**It has to be on the page**

> "Unless we’re aware of both what Ann wants and what she then gets instead, all the body language in the world will be rendered mute. This sounds obvious, but you’d be surprised how often writers forget to let us know what a character hopes will happen, so that when it doesn’t, we have no idea their expectations have been dashed." (Cron, Page 59)

Both character expectation/understanding _and_ audience expectation/understanding matter.

- Do I need to introduce the notion of two different tracks here? There's the experience of the protagonist and the experience of the audience. They may go tightly together. But they may also diverge in interesting ways, especially around knowledge. For good reasons, a storyteller may decide to give the protagonist more information than the audience or less. And, what is catastrophic for the protagonist may be deliciously engaging for the audience (and vice versa).

To be clear means that there are no obstacles to your reader's understanding. 

This doesn't mean you lack style, complexity, or difficulty. But these should _add_ to comprehension of the experience, not take from it.

Line-level spelling and grammar matter. Pave a [smooth path]({% post_url 2022-08-11-interest-effort %}).

Beyond that, make your ideas concrete. Use specific details, examples, [comparisons]({% post_url 2022-12-19-comparison-creates-meaning %}). Paint a picture with things you can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. Pure concepts are slippery, hard to grasp. Concreteness adds hooks and handles so your reader can catch what you're slinging.

What matters most is the flow of your thoughts. Say one thing at a time. Show how each idea relates to the next. 

- Use disasters to [motivate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGUNqq3jVLg) your character decisions — and have those [decisions lead to more disasters]({% post_url 2022-10-24-scene-sequel-acts %}).
- Give your reader a sense of progress. Where appropriate, use tools like quests, multi-part goals, and countdowns to help them [understand where they are](https://www.worldbuilders.ai/p/4-pillars-story-structure#3-progression) — and hint at where they're going.

A comprehensible [structure covers a multitude of sins]({% post_url 2015-08-15-structure-vs-style %}).


## Engaging

To be engaging means that you keep your reader interested. Your writing has a sense of purpose and momentum.

In fiction, you create this with empathetic characters, narrative drive, and pacing.

#### Empathetic characters

The most straightforward way to get your reader to care about your story is with a character they can care about. Like links in a chain, if your reader cares about your character, and if your character believably cares about your story's outcome, your reader will care about that outcome too.

- To make your reader feel empathy for your character, show your character's admirable attributes. Demonstrate their proactivity, competence, or moral character. Have them attempt worthy feats, gain the regard of friendly characters, and endure suffering at the hands of villains.
- To make your character care about the story's outcome, have them desire and pursue a goal. Make it specific, concrete, and central to the story. (If goal and story aren't aligned, you risk your reader caring more about a tangent than your main story.)

#### Narrative drive

Narrative drive is uncertainty that demands a resolution. It's gravity, pulling your reader in. It plays on dopamine in the brain's reward system, creating a state of _wanting_.

You set up narrative drive by creating "open loops" that your reader cannot wait to close. Mysteries, cliff-hangers, setups that promise some kind of payoff. Will the protagonist win the tournament, conquer the villain, marry the billionaire? Only the story will tell.

To keep a reader engaged, _prove you can deliver_. Regularly pay off little promises along the way. In doing so, you build reader anticipation for each new payoff — and for the final payoff at the end.

But. Always, always, always keep at least _one_ loop open. The moment you close all the loops, narrative drive evaporates.

#### Pacing

Pacing has to do with the throttling of tension and movement in a piece. Even high tension, if monotonous, becomes boring. The sweetest musical note begins to grate after a few minutes uninterrupted. Our minds crave movement, novelty, variation.

Force your protagonist to deal with disasters, face dilemmas, make decisions, pursue goals. Vary your length. Avoid overly long stretches of exposition, introspection, or mindless action. Follow a moment of tension with quiet release. Tell a joke before diving into horror. Occasionally, let your reader rest. Then sprint again.

To combat the law of diminishing returns, continually increase the stakes. What does your protagonist stand to win or lose? (In nonfiction, what are the implications of your idea?) Start small and then ratchet up. Move from simple to profound. In the beginning, Luke Skywalker just wants to finish his chores so he can hang out with his friends. By the end, he's saving the galaxy. 

But remember, stakes are less about physical scope and more about continuously [making your reader care _more_](https://theweeklyemail.storyandplot.com/raise-the-stakes). It's not breadth but depth. We don't care about the ten thousand orcs, the end of an age, the entire world shadowed by Sauron's darkness, until we care about two little hobbits climbing a mountain with a ring.


## Affecting

To be affecting means you make your reader feel something. 

The thrill of adventure, horror, wonder, romance, epiphany. There are more flavors of feeling than there are genres on bookstore shelves. To be satisfying, a story must inspire some kind of emotional response.

Even [idea stories]({% post_url 2024-04-02-beginning-middle-end-4 %}), which focus more on the brain than the heart, succeed or fail based on their ability to give readers an experience. The reason their fans rave is not the ideas themselves but the _feeling of insight_ as those ideas unfurl.

#### Story, meet reader

To deliver affect is a dance, a proper matching of partners. Your story must give your reader the specific feeling they seek, and different readers seek different feelings. 

So, start by capturing the right audience. Clearly signal, at the beginning of your story, what feeling you will create. The opening of _Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark_ has almost nothing to do with the rest of the story, but it tells its audience what to expect. This way, the right people opt in to enjoying the story. The fans select themselves.

#### Pay off the promise

Once you match, you must fulfill your contract. Deliver what you promise. Close the loop, answer the question, land the plane.

Even better, fulfill _what_ you said but in a _way your reader never expected_. Deliver more and better.

There's a trick here. [Neuroscience suggests]({% post_url 2022-06-10-pae-breakthrough %}) that peak emotional experiences happen when a person feels a rise in tension followed by a quick release. The steeper the change, the greater the impact.

The moment before the breakthrough should feel intractable. There must be no way out. Let your reader stew in the tension. Caught in the snare, the fox pulls and pulls and pulls against the iron teeth of the trap. The hunter appears. He approaches, taking his time, gloating.
 
Then, the answer arrives in a flash. The way opens. The fox tears free.

But the release must be [properly motivated]({% post_url 2023-08-12-deus-ex-machina-and-satisfying-story-ending %}). Although it felt incomprehensible in the approach, it _must make perfect sense_ in hindsight. In the words of David Mamet, it's “inevitable yet unforeseen.” <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#mamet1998">Mamet</a>, Location 426.)</cite>

You set it up earlier with an offhand comment or extraneous detail. But it's only now, looking back, that your reader sees that it was there all the time. It couldn't have been any other way.

#### It's about values

One more tip: Peak emotional experiences generally have to do with [core values]({% post_url 2022-04-08-pae-content %}#resonance-with-values). If you want to provoke the deepest emotional response in your reader, focus your attention there. 

What behaviors and attitudes do you believe are the most honorable, most admirable, most worthy of imitation? Take those values and find ways to put them on the line. Challenge them. Torture them under extreme, impossible pressure. Then, at the end, let them stand proud, bruised but unbroken, vindicated in glory.


## Meaningful

To be meaningful means you leave your reader changed. In some small but significant way, her life, her worldview, her beliefs have been impacted by the experience.

Meaning emerges from how your reader experiences your piece. It speaks to your reader somewhere deep, below surface-level consciousness.

#### Inhabit the story

When people are engrossed in a story, the same neural pathways activate as if they were, themselves, facing the dilemmas and performing the actions in the story. (CITATION NEEDED)

Thus, if the dilemmas and actions in your story have thematic grist, your reader will be able to climb inside your story's meaning, try it on for size, walk around in it a little bit. Like leather, the longer you wear a theme, the more it fits.

#### Structure speaks

On a mechanical level, you [use structure to construct a thematic argument]({% post_url 2023-09-16-thesis-antithesis-synthesis %}). How you juxtapose sentences, paragraphs, sequences, acts — all this conveys meaning. 

To paraphrase Melanie Anne Phillips, "A slap followed by a scream is an attack. A scream followed by a slap is bringing someone to their senses." <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#phillips2009">Phillips</a>, Loc 1783)</cite>

What comes before and after is just as important as what happens between.

#### Value judgments

Beyond that, both the feelings you evoke as events transpire and the consequences that result from character decisions communicate value judgments. Does your emotional tone celebrate the moment of revenge or spurn it? Does your story world reward your protagonist for helping someone weaker than themselves or punish them for it?

If your reader is sufficiently engaged, they will feel those judgments, too.

#### Style matters

You also convey meaning by manipulating the style and level of difficulty of your piece. Is your language easy and informal? Rich with poetic imagery? Technical and dense? Do you tie up every loose end and wrap things up with a button, or do you leave threads hanging, naggingly unresolved? None of these is inherently better or worse as long as you do them with intention. But each choice will communicate different values to your reader.

When combined, the elements of emotion, structure, value, and style create something greater than the sum of their parts. One and one make three. Iron and lead become gold. 

The result is an experience with lasting meaning.

## Conclusion

Different tools are useful for different purposes. A hammer is great for driving in nails, but less so for turning screws. What I give you here is a framework that I've found useful. But it's only a tool. Other tools exist, which may be better for the story work with which you are engaged.

So. Don't get stuck on the rules. [It's okay to do something that's not technically "right."](https://theweeklyemail.storyandplot.com/the-questions-you-ask-matter/?ck_subscriber_id=2652330540) Just be sure you deliver your intent. 

When you can do that, you've made an "ergonomic" story. You've fit you reader. 

And that means you've done well.
