## What is the gap?

## The gap vs. the rule of three

Both the gap and the [rule of three]() use subversion of expectation. However, they use it for very different purposes.

- McKee's gap is about subverting expectation to create a new, unresolved _dilemma_. The protagonist expected the light to be red. It's blue instead. What will she do?
- The rule of three, on the other hand, is about subverting expectation to create a surprising _resolution_. "I came, I saw, I had a sandwich."

Structurally, the rule of three _closes_ an arc, while McKee's gap _opens_ one.

The subjective effect for the audience is also different. 
- The arc of the rule of three ends with the resolution of tension, while the gap serves to increase tension. 
- The subversion of expectations in the rule of three delivers satisfaction, the subversion of expectations in the gap increases narrative drive.

## The gap and narrative drive

McKee's gap helps us understand narrative drive.

A character expects one thing but the story world gives them something else. This makes the audience _want to know what happens next_. It creates uncertainty that demands a resolution.

There are two key elements here:

1. Empathy with the character
2. Uncertainty

See also the [interest-effort formula]().

## Why it works

Uncertainty hooks into our brains' reward circuits.

## Examples

_Pride and Prejudice_ when Darcy proposes. Elizabeth is just smarting from the knowledge that he detatched Bingley from Jane. Then Darcy comes for a visit. Elizabeth is expecting an awkward visit and wants him to leave as soon as possible but lo â€” he proposes to marry her!

## How to construct it

Define what needs to happen next for the plot to work.

Look at what has happened so far, and set up an expectation that the character can hold. 

The expectation must be: 
- Reasonable, based on what has happened so far
- Different than what will actually happen

## No cheap tricks

Most of all, the difference must feel relevant to the story, either for the plot, the character's journey of transformation, or the story's theme. It won't be as powerful if you just create surprises for their own sake.

No "clickbait."
