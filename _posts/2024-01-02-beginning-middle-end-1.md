<p class="dropCap">Perhaps the most popular of the story structure primitives we owe to Aristotle. Quite a few story experts have cited him over the years, proclaiming the excellencies of his magical formula: beginning, middle, and end.</p>

I confess, when I first encountered this, it frustrated me. It seemed both obvious and unhelpful. Of _course_ a beginning is a beginning, a middle a middle, an end an end. The descriptions felt like tautologies, using the words to define themselves.

At some point, I decided to read _Poetics_. In doing so, I discovered that I'd missed Aristotle's point.

Here's what he said:

> "Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is complete, and whole . . . A whole is that which has a beginning, a middle, and an end." <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#aristotle1895">Aristotle</a>, Part VII)</cite>

Do you see it? Aristotle isn't focused on creating a structural roadmap here. Instead, he's making a point about _completeness_.

> "A beginning is that which _does not itself follow anything by causal necessity_, but after which something naturally is or comes to be. An end, on the contrary, is that which itself naturally follows some other thing, either by necessity, or as a rule, but _has nothing following it_. A middle is that which follows something as some other thing follows it." <cite>(<a href="/bibliography#aristotle1895">Aristotle</a>, Part VII)</cite> (Emphasis mine.)

There's a lot packed in there. Let's look closely.

What Aristotle is saying — as near as I can tell — is that a story should contain _every essential part_ of itself and _nothing extra_.

- Want to know where your story begins? Look for the beginning of "causal necessity." What's the first essential domino to fall — the one that sets everything off? If you start much before that, you're including extra details that aren't part of the story. If you start after it, you're missing something.
- Likewise, if you need to know where your story ends, look for the point at which nothing "follows . . . by necessity." Ending before that leaves the story incomplete. Ending after that introduces more needless extras. 
- The middle is the thing that connects the two, the [chain of meaningfully related events]({% post_url 2022-12-07-anecdote-reflection %}) between the beginning of causality and the end of necessity.

Aristotle's point isn’t (primarily, at least) to identify different structural sections of a story. His point is that a story should be _whole_.
