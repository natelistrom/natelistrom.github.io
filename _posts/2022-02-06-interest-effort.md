<p class="dropCap">How do storytellers connect with their audiences? How do you, as a storyteller, share a story that keeps your audience engaged, wanting to come back for more? There are, of course, probably as many answers to that question as there are storytellers and stories.</p>

Every story and every audience is different, but there are some general patters that apply. At the most basic level, you must carefully balance what I'm calling the audience interest-effort formula.

Every story is composed of both content and form.

_Content_ is the story you want to tell, the ideas and feelings you want to convey. Content can be anything. It can be a story about an intelligent young woman who bucks her society's expectations in order to find true love. Or, it can be a story about a petrified paleontologist who learns to grow as a person by embracing the chaos and unpredictability of the future. It can be funny or sad or inspiring or depressing (or all of them at once). You get to choose, and you can choose almost anything.

_Form_ is the manner in which you tell your story, the words and sentences and structures you employ.<sup class="aside">A</sup> Unlike content, form is bound by certain rules, certain “physics,” if you will.

Think of form as a pipeline through which the content of your story flows.

With physical pipelines, the rules are things like fluid dynamics, weight and material strength, entropy. With storytelling, our "pipelines" are contingent upon the strengths and limitations of your audience's minds.

If you build a section of pipe pointing straight up into the sky, you’ll need a lot more pressure to get your liquid flowing through it than if it’s running down hill. It's not impossible, but it's good to know what you're getting into so you can address it properly. The same goes for storytelling.

When telling stories, we need to be aware of the factors that affect our "pipelines." Among these are interest and effort.

You can think of interest as the fluid pressure in the pipeline. It's motivation, the reason that an audience engages with a story. Every audience begins a story with a basic motivation. Often, it's purely curiosity or a desire to be entertained. You could think of it as a willingness to give the story a fair shake. Your job as a storyteller is to encourage this interest and help it to grow, to not let down the audience's trust but instead provide even more than they were looking for.

Effort is resistance. It's friction inside the pipeline, or elevation to which the fluid must be channeled. It's the _work_ that the audience must do in order to engage with the story. Every story has practical and mechanical things that it must employ: the use of language, exposition and setups, ideas and themes. It's your job as a storyteller to ensure that these things are communicated in such a way that it either minimizes effort or makes that effort meaningful through payoff.<sup class="aside">B</sup> 

<aside>
B. Think of problem-solving games, for example, or mountain-climbing. These activities involve a fair amount of resistance, but that is the point. They’re satisfying in part because of the sense of achievement at having overcome the challenge. Sometimes, story can be like this as well, though storytellers need to be careful to agree with their audiences, up front, about the effort involved.
</aside>

I think of interest and effort as weights placed on the opposite sides of a scale. The more weight on either side, the more likely the scale will tip in that direction. As a storyteller, you can get away with some effort, but you must offset the balance with a corresponding weight of interest. The more effort your story requires of the audience, the more interest you must provide to keep them motivated.

These two sides of the scale — interest and effort — determine how your story will be received. A healthy dose of interest will keep the audience engaged. Too much effort, and they will leave for greener pastures. The general rule is that interest must outweigh effort.

As with every rule, this guideline can be broken in order to create a particular effect. Perhaps the effort of engaging with the story is part of the purpose of the art. The audience member who sticks it out gains the satisfaction in having conquered a particularly difficult challenge. This is a legitimate expression of creativity. However, if you break the rules this way, you should understand that your work will have a limited audience. The average pedestrian doesn’t regularly climb mountains. You must be content with that. And, like the climb up a steep mountain, it's nice to provide a significant payoff to those few, intrepid climbers who have given your their time and effort and made it all the way up.

The ideal is that your storytelling should provide, within the bounds of the story you want to tell, the maximum possible interest while requiring the minimum possible effort.
