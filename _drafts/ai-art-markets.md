In some circles, 2022 is becoming the year of generative AI. We've seen the arrival of major players in the art space, like [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), [Sable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release), and [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com). There have also been major releases in the chat and search spaces, among others, but my focus here will be with AI-generated art.

There are a number of controversies that have arisen with the arrival of these technologies. A couple of them are worth note, but I'll keep my focus in this post to just one: <strong>What will happen to artist's jobs?</strong>

The quality of the art created by these technologies is all over the spectrum, but some of it is _astonishingly_ good. Good enough that, as a designer, it gives me pause. It's only a matter of time until the same sort of generative AI that's currently being used to mimic today's digital artists will be applied to my discipline.

And, the technologies will only get better and better. If the marked difference between DALL-E and DALL-E 2 is anything to go by, we can expect the quality of results to become increasingly competitive with each new version.

Back in 2020, I wrote a [short blog post]({% post_url 2020-06-22-technicians-to-talent %}) about a pattern I saw as technologies came to creative markets. I think something similar will happen with AI art, so I'd like to revisit the ideas and expand on them some.

I'll use the print industry as a point of reference. In the eighties and nineties, desktop publishing brought printing out of the purview of large companies and into the home. In the nineties and early oughts, on-demand printing carved out another, similar niche.

As these waves of technology hit, four noteworthy things happened:

1. Overall, the market got larger

In the pre-1980s days of printing, there were only a few options for professional print. At the top of the market were traditional printing technologies like letterpress. They were bespoke and fit for small volumes and &mdash; at least in the United States' expensive labor market &mdash; relatively expensive. Under that was the purview of professional print shops that ran large offset printers. They produced at scale and served mostly businesses that could afford to do large runs. Some offices also ran printing on office copy machines. Thus, there were essentially three main types of providers in the market.

With the advent of desktop publishing and, later, on-demand printing, suddenly, there were a whole new set of providers entering the market. On the low end, a person could by a home printer and create postcards and flyers themselves, without any provider (other than the hardware manufacturer). FedEx, UPS, and Kinko's carved out a niche for consumers and small businesses who didn't want to mess with the hassle of owning a copy machine. And a hole raft of online, print-on-demand services like Zazzle, Shutterfly, and VistaPrint emerged, providing everything from photobooks to coffee mugs.

2. The market stratified and new roles were created

With the increase in the number of providers in the market, the markets also stratified. New price tiers emerged. If you wanted to do a short run of flyers for a birthday party, you could print them yourself or have them run off at Staples or Kinko's. If you needed Christmas Cards or wedding invitations, you could take them to a print-on-demand service or a local print shop (who probably produced them on four-color laser printers instead of the traditional offset presses). Businesses still printed things in-house on more advanced copy machines or sent them out print shops. And, of course, for higher-end weddings and formal events, there was still the hand-crafted approach with letterpress, etc.

The point is, with the new entrants into the market, there were also different solutions that were created. And new jobs that came with those solutions. On the one hand, with desktop publishing, literally _anyone_ whose family or friend owned a printer could create something. On the other hand, services like Kinkos and Zazzle created retail and technologist jobs.

3. The price curve widened
