## What's this all about?

Others have written far better introductions to AI art than I can. Rather than compete, I'll just sum up a few points for context:

- 2022 has become a significant year for generative AI &mdash; machine learning models that take large quantities of data and learn how to produce new outputs based on that learning. 
- We've seen the arrival of major players in the art space, like [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release), and [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com).
- The quality of the art created by these tools is inconsistent, but some of it is _astonishingly_ good, and the technologies will only improve with time.
- A number of controversies have arisen around these technologies. While I feel some are based on well-founded concerns, that particular discussion is beyond the scope of this post. Here, I'm focused exclusively on how art markets and artist's jobs may change in response to these new tools.

## Learning from history

As [some have already observed](https://twitter.com/wickedinsignia/status/1603266393914605569?s=20&t=CsV5-yQ-462CbyLLSORNow) no analogy is perfect. Innovation is, by definition, unprecedented. Nevertheless, I think that you and I can make some useful observations by considering historical analogies. What has happened in the past when new technologies have changed the market landscape? Are there patterns we can see, which might apply here? The exercise can be instructive.

The trick, of course, is to know _which_ analogies are helpful and which ones are false comparisons. As the author of Dynomight.net [demonstrates](https://dynomight.net/llms/), the possible analogies are as varied as the conclusions they point to.

Together with you, I'd like to consider three analogies based on fields with which I have at least a little experience: print, design, and ceramics.

## Print: a change in the market landscape

The print industry saw a transformation between the 1980s and the 2010s with desktop publishing.

Before the technological revolutions that introduced desktop publishing, much of commercial printing was done with offset presses. The machines were large, expensive, and complex. Together, cost and complexity created effective gates to access in the market. Only those who had resources and specialized training could be in the print business.

Then, over the course of thirty or forty years, technological innovations like inkjet and laser printing changed all that. Suddenly, the tools were accessible to nearly everyone, including individuals and small and medium-sized businesses who had historically been kept out.

There were several notable effects.

1. First, the overall market got bigger. There were more people producing and more people consuming print services.
2. Second, as new capabilities came into the market, the proportion of the market held by the traditional incumbents got smaller. (When I was doing a lot of print graphic design around 2008-2014, most of our work was produced on commercial laser printers. Very little of what we did was on traditional offset printing, and some of the vendors I worked with didn't even own traditional presses.)
3. Third, new players carved out their own corners in the existing market. For example, OfficeMax, Staples, UPS, FedEx, and Kinko's leveraged the change in print technology to create a niche serving businesses that didn't want to mess with the hassle of owning and operating their own machines. (This directly competed with Xerox and the office printer.)
4. Fourth, entirely new markets were created. Companies like Shutterfly, VistaPrint, and Zazzle leveraged new technology to build a totally new consumer market for online, print-on-demand products.

I think we can expect to see similar effects in the art space with AI art generation.

## Design: how the market change affected people's jobs

Before the desktop publishing revolution, if I wanted to create a brochure, I'd most likely have to employ a graphic designer.

Similar to the print industry, there were gates on access: 

- I'd need to consider the cost of contracting with a designer. 
- The designer would need to have access to the right tools and have the technical knowledge to know how to use them. 
- Lastly, hopefully, the designer would have the skill, talent, and training to know what they were doing.

But before the desktop publishing revolution, a designer could make a living on the first two &mdash; price and tools &mdash; without necessarily having the skill or talent.

When the desktop publishing revolution removed the technological barrier, it had a number of ripple effects.

1. Technical knowledge was no longer a good differentiator. Seeing a market opportunity, the companies producing home publishing software intentionally removed adoption barriers, making the process of designing in their tools as simple and easy as possible. They included pre-made templates and clip art so that anyone could be successful. You no longer needed to be a technician to design something. (For more on this, see my earlier post on [phases in creative markets]({% post_url 2020-06-22-technicians-to-talent %}).)
2. Price was no longer a good differentiator. When anyone with access to software could "design" a brochure, the entry point for cost in the market became virtually zero. This put more pressure on some designers, especially freelancers, to compete at lower and lower relative rates in order to scrape by. Competing on cost alone became a losing game.
3. Quality became a more significant differentiator. The pre-packaged templates and 1990s clip art style became hallmarks of cheap design. Recognizing this perception, businesses that could afford to contract with skilled designers moved up-market, differentiating on quality and uniqueness.
4. Demand for exceptional skill and talent created a small, premium niche at the top of the market. As an interesting second-order effect, a larger proportion of the population became "design literate." (Attempting to do a thing yourself increases your appreciation for those who do it well, after all.) Increasing design literacy created space for a niche demand for exceptional quality at the top of the market. Companies like Apple capitalized on this appetite. (Of course, desktop publishing was only on contributor to increasing design literacy out of many.)
5. Some people who might otherwise have never entered the market did so, because the tools awakened them to the possibilities. Where before, someone would not get exposed to the act of designing unless they lucked out, now anyone with access to the software could experiment and, potentially, discover a love for it. (I count myself among these. Playing around with desktop publishing software was a part of my journey.)

We _might_ see similar things happen with AI art generation and jobs in art markets, though I think the similarties here may be fewer than in the print analogy. More on that later.

## Ceramics: commercial scale and hand-made crafts

The last analogy is, unfortunately, the most depressing.

For thousands of years, ceramics have been an important staple in home goods. Throughout history and even today, they're used both as everyday, common commercial goods and also as art and luxury goods.

Historically, of course, the only way to get ceramics was to make them by hand. The same skill was needed to create art pieces for the elite and everyday cookware for common consumption.

Once ceramics could be mass-produced on an industrial scale, however, that dynamic shifted. There was no longer any need to produce everyday cookware by hand. Throwing pots by hand was slower, less predictable, and more prone to error and waste. So common commercial goods production shifted entirely to industrial production. Jobs in ceramics for creating common commercial goods don't really exist anymore.

However, even today there _does_ remain a niche market for hand-made pottery. Some people still make their living entirely on creating pottery, either as art or luxury goods. But the proportion of the population who can make a living this way is much lower than it was before industrialization.

It's likely we'll see a similar effect in some art fields with the advent of AI art generation.
