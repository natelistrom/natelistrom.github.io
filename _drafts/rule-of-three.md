<p class="dropCap">The rule of three is a powerful, three-beat storytelling structural mechanic. In the words of webcomic author and <em>Writing Excuses</em> co-host Howard Tayler, it&rsquo;s, &ldquo;beat, beat, punchline. Thing one, thing two, thing three, where we are escalating . . . We have three beats, and the third one is the longest, and the third one is the most specific.&rdquo; (Writing Excuses 11.32)</p>

Where storytelling techniques like [comparison]({% post_url 2022-12-19-comparison-creates-meaning %}) and [bracketing]({% post_url 2023-01-12-bracketing %}) are about communicating _meaning_ to your audience, you can use the rule of three to deliver _satisfaction_.

## How it works

#### Two beats create a trajectory

Under the hood, the rule of three works by setting up and then paying off audience expectation.

How does it do this? Imagine, for a moment, that I draw two dots on a sheet of paper.

<img src="/assets/img/rule-of-three-0.png" alt="" />

In our minds, this creates an _implied trajectory_.

An observer could look at those two dots, mentally draw a line connecting them, and make a reasonable prediction about where a third dot might be drawn.

<img src="/assets/img/rule-of-three-1.png" alt="" />

We humans make these kids of inferences all the time. It's built into us. Author and story coach Lisa Cron puts it well: "We're wired to predict what will happen next, and _the way we do this is by charting patterns_." <sup>{% include cron-2012.html %} Page 159.</sup> (Emphasis mine.) When we see a partial pattern, we can't help but predict how it will complete.

The rule of three leverages this human proclivity toward pattern-based predictions, but rather than dots on a graph, it does this with story beats.
 
The hunter saw the stag (beat one). He raised the rifle to his shoulder and aimed (beat two) . . .

The trajectory is set. The audience has an expectation. The hunter will pull the trigger. The gun will fire. The stag will die. (Or, the hunter will miss, and the stag will escape.)

The first two beats give a promise to the audience, creating expectation.

That expectation must be paid off, which is what the third beat does.

## Why does it work?

#### The knowledge instinct and reward systems

`NOTE: This first part about the knowledge instinct is all about the _wanting/setup_ component. Yet the excerpt about the monkeys is more focused on the _liking/payoff_ component. Need to find a way to set both up well.`

To understand why this kind of technique is so effective, we need to know a little bit about the neuroscience involved. Let's take a moment to talk about what happens in audience members' brains when they recognize this kind of two-beat setup. It's pretty fascinating.

In [an earlier note]({% post_url 2022-04-15-pae-expectation %}), we learned about the "knowledge instinct," an idea set forth by researchers Schoeller and Perlovsky that humans posess a "drive to modify existing representations to match patterns in sensory signals." <sup>{% include schoellerAndPerlovsky-2016.html %} The instinct of knowledge section.</sup>

The knowledge instinct powers a process by which we learn, building and updating our mental models of the world around us. (Barrett, Page 62) It achieves this by detecting unresolved questions and making us hungry for answers. Whenever we detect an unresolved mystery, we can't wait to find out the resolution. In storytelling, this has significant implications for narrative drive, the thing that keeps audience members hooked to a story, eagerly anticipating the next payoff.

The way that the knowledge instinct motivates this "hunger" for answers is by hooking into our brains' reward circuitry, <sup>{% include schoellerAndPerlovsky-2016.html %} Conclusion section.</sup> which operates in part by using dopamine signals to track what are called "reward prediction errors." (Bromberg-Martin, 2010, Dopamine in Reward: Conventional Theory) 

Whenever our brains detect the possibility of a future reward (like the resolution to a mystery), they focus in, making a prediction about what that reward will be. Then, when we obtain the reward, our brains compare what the _actual_ value of the reward was against the prediction. (Was the murderer the butler, after all? Or&mdash;surprise!&mdash;was it the heiress instead?) 

Our reward systems will send different signals depending on whether or not our predictions were correct, which ultimately helps us update our mental models to more accurately represent the world around us. With enough practice, we learn to be suspicious of butlers and heiresses.

Here's how neuroscientist Read Montague describes the research in his book, _Your Brain is (Almost) Perfect_:

> "The reward-prediction error signal . . . was first identified using experiments in monkeys, where lights predicted the future arrival of juice squirts a short time later. When the light is initially presented, there is no change in dopamine neuron activity . . . However, the arrival of the juice a short time later causes a burst of activity in the dopamine neurons. <sup>{% include montague-2006.html %} Page 113.</sup>

The monkeys didn't know what to expect when they saw the flashing light, so, when they received the juice, their reward systems triggered a dopamine response that told their brains, "Wow! Something better than expected just happened!" <sup>{% include montague-2006.html %} Page 113.</sup>

Here's the interesting part, though. Over time, the monkeys learned the connection between the flashing light and the arrival of the juice: 

> If the light-juice pairs are repeatedly delivered to the subject . . . remarkable changes occur. The initial response associated with the juice, the 'things are better than expected' response, goes away . . . The neurons no longer change their activity when the juice arrives following the light. This means that the dopamine system has _learned to expect the time and amount of juice delivered_." <sup>{% include montague-2006.html %} Page 113.</sup> (Emphasis mine.)

Montague goes on to explain that, over time, the firing of the monkeys' dopamine neurons shifted. At first, their reward circuitry lit up when the juice arrived. But, once they'd learned the pattern, the monkeys' reward circuitry began to fire earlier in the sequence&mdash;when they saw the light&mdash;but _not_ when they received the juice: 

> "The neurons now report that the _light_ is 'better than expected'; that is, they react to the light in the same fashion that they reacted initially to the juice." <sup>{% include montague-2006.html %} Page 113.</sup> (Emphasis mine.)

There are a couple of things worth our attention here. 

First, the monkeys eventually learned to expect the juice when they saw the light flash. Their knowledge instinct, powered by their reward systems, helped them update their mental models of the world. The monkeys started off with a model that had no reference for juice paired with a flashing light, but once they experienced it enough, they learned the pattern. Their reward predictions updated to create an expectation.

Second, when the monkeys experienced the juice early on, their reward systems went crazy, triggering a "better than expected" reward signal. A light flashed, and their untrained brains didn't know what to expect. What they got was surprising and good. This resulted in excited reward activity. 

But eventually, once they learned the pattern, the brain activity upon receiving the reward quieted down. It shifted from surprised delight at receiving the _juice_ to expectant anticipation when seeing the _light_. The juice itself was no longer as captivating. The juice was presumed.

What does this mean for us?

First, when you set up a trajectory for your audience, it creates a sense of anticipation. Like the light flashing for the trained monkeys, a trajectory hooks into your audience members' reward circuitry and creates an expectation that the pattern will be completed. Seeing the two "dots on the graph" of your storyline, your audience members' brains can't help but try to predict where the third will be. This creates a drive in the knowledge instinct, almost like a hunger, to close the loop and discover the resolution. The hunter saw the stag. He raised the rifle to his shoulder and aimed . . . It's a cliffhanger. Your audience _wants to see what happens next_.

Second, if the outcome is exactly what your audience expected, it will fail to meaningfully engage their reward signals. Like the trained monkeys whose reward systems no longer triggered when the juice arrived, if there is no prediction error&mdash;no difference between what a person expected and what they actually encountered&mdash;their mental models don't need to be updated. Their reward system says, "Meh. Nothing to see here; let's move on." Over time, predictable payoffs shift your audience's experience from surprised delight to bored presumption. Thus, the best payoff must have some element of surprise to it.

## Surprising yet inevitable

Let's return to our graph for a moment. Remember that we looked at the first two points and predicted where a third point would go.

<img src="/assets/img/rule-of-three-1.png" alt="" />

If I draw the third point _exactly_ where we previously predicted, the first time it happens, an observer might experience a little bit of satisfaction. If nothing else, he or she can feel smart and say, "Yep, I saw that coming." But imagine that we do this over and over again. After a while, that predictability becomes boring. Even the little satisfaction at seeing the prediction come true goes away.

"Familiar patterns are safe," explains Lisa Cron. They don't capture our attention. And now, thinking about Montague's example of the monkeys, we understand why. Once your reward system becomes trained to a pattern, there's no longer anything to get excited about.

So, what can we as storytellers do to avoid this kind of situation? The obvious answer is, _change something in the pattern_. Do something that belies prediction. Add an element of surprise.

Let's go back to the graph. This time, imagine that instead of following the predicted trajectory, the third dot is somewhere _else_.

<img src="/assets/img/rule-of-three-2.png" alt="" />

Now, all of a sudden, something interesting has happened again. Our expectation has been subverted. We're forced to engage with this unanticipated result and attempt to make sense of it. Perhaps we realize that instead of charting a straight line, the dots were actually charting a curve all along.

<img src="/assets/img/rule-of-three-3.png" alt="" />

Suddenly, our brains re-orient, recognizing a new pattern. This re-orientation creates something really special. Our knowledge instinct kicks in, recognizing the difference between what we predicted and what we actually encountered, and we update our mental models. Subjectively, this manifests as an "aha!" moment. We have a flash of recognition. If especially profound, it can even feel like an epiphany.

This is, of course, the classic mechanic behind jokes. Jokes, illusions, and mysteries all thrive on misdirection â€” setting up a trajectory for the audience and then subverting it in a way that's unexpected but still fulfills the original promise of the setup.

Here's webcomic author and _Writing Excuses_ podcast co-host Howard Tayler:

> "A great many funny stories are when you are telling a story that is kind of funny and then you get to the end of it and you realize, 'Oh, I was actually being told a very different story, and that's kind of hilarious,' as everything is re-contextualized and new." (Writing Excuses 11.32; Howard Tayler)

Tayler goes on later in the podcast episode to give this example:

> "When we had the episode with Jim Hines . . . I introduced him and said, 'All the men want to be like him, and all the women want to be with those men.' Which is a fantastic comic drop . . . 'and all the women want to be withâ€¦ him,' is what you're expecting. The very last word is now gone and is now replaced with 'other men.'" (Writing Excuses 11.32; Howard Tayler; emphasis mine)

Editor and story analyst Shawn Coyne calls this "surprising yet inevitable." [#needtofix  citation] The idea is that your audience couldn't have predicted beforehand where the third dot will be, but once it's revealed, they cannot see how it could have been any other way.

Achieving that consistently, of course, takes some [skill and a lot of work](Suzuki).

There's a pitfall to avoid here. Although the third dot on the graph subverts the prediction, it must in some way be coherent with the original to dots.

"The hunter saw the stag. He raised his gun. He fired," is banal and predictable. (It provides a little bit of satisfaction, especially because of escalation. More on that later.)

"The hunter saw the stag. He raised his gun. He got a pedicure," is absurd. It does, indeed, confound prediction. But it doesn't pay off of the trajectory in a way that feels inevitable. It's totally out of left field.

So you see the challenge? To pull off the rule of three, you must perform a bit of storytelling sleight of hand. You must show your audience a pattern that appears to be setting up one thing while, in fact, it is setting up something else. Both the banal, expected ending and the real, surprising one must be coherent with the preceding trajectory. They must both "fulfill the brief," so to speak. But the actual payoff subverts expectations in some way.
 
Note: possibly one minor contributing factor to why deus ex machine can fall flat. Hasnâ€™t been set up/too out of left field.

Let's take one more example from the _Writing Excuses_ crew and unpack it to see why it works. I choose this one because it seems to break the rules but in fact does not.
Here's Brandon Sanderson:
[Brandon] "I see [the rule of three] a lot in fiction as lists. He walked in the room and saw a desk, a lamp, and a big green monster eating a burrito." (Writing Excuses 11.32; Brandon Sanderson)
At first, the third beat in this example seems to commit the sin of being too disconnected. The big green monster has nothing to do with a desk and a lamp, right?
Yet it works. How come?
In this case, there are two threads. The first thread describes things that the character saw in the room. "He saw this, then he saw that, then he saw the other."  The second thread, which is laid down at the same time, describes what's normal and abnormal. "Desk: normal. Lamp: normal. Monster: _abnormal_." 
While the third beat violates the expectation of the second thread, it is completely consistent with the first thread. In this way, it's still "playing by the rules." Our brains say, "Okay, you got me. I was expecting something normal and you surprised me with something abnormal. But, since you are still describing things in the room, I'll let that one pass."
As storytellers, we have a lot of creative directions we can explore to find the optimal point of difference.

More than three works as well
If more than three, you may need to communicate to the audience about when to expect the end of the series. Otherwise, it can be difficult to predict and feel edgy (unless, of course, this is the intended effect as in psychological thrillers, suspense, and horror.)
According to Booker, there are four main variations on the rule of three: simple, progressive, contrasting, dialectical
"We see this rule of three expressed in four main ways:" (Booker, Page 231)
(1) The â€˜simpleâ€™ or â€˜cumulative threeâ€™, where each thing is of much the same value, but all three have to be put together or succeed each other in sequence before the hero or heroine can move on, or come to their final transformation: e.g., Cinderellaâ€™s three visits to the ball, the three treasure-caves Aladdin has to go through before he discovers the lamp." (Booker, Page 231)
(2) The â€˜progressiveâ€™ or â€˜ascending threeâ€™, where each thing is of positive value but each a little more important or valuable than the last: e.g., the ascending value of Jackâ€™s three treasures won from the giant." (Booker, Page 231)
"There is also the â€˜descending threeâ€™, where each is of negative value, but similarly working up to a climax (e.g., Red Riding Hoodâ€™s three questions to the wolf, leading to â€˜all the better to eat you withâ€™ as the wolf reveals his true deadly character)." (Booker, Page 231)
(3) The â€˜contrastingâ€™ or â€˜double-negative threeâ€™, where the first two are inadequate or wrong (essentially in the same way) and only the third one works or succeeds. We see an element of this in the three little pigs, two of whom get eaten, although it is most commonly seen in folk tales where the hero or heroine is the third child, contrasted with two identical others, usually older, who are dark. Cinderellaâ€™s two â€˜ugly sistersâ€™  are as alike as identical twins. They are there merely to present a double-negative to Cinderellaâ€™s positive." (Booker, Page 231)
(4) The final form of three, the one capable of the most sophisticated development, is what may be called the â€˜dialectical threeâ€™  where, as we see reflected in Goldilocks, the first is wrong in one way, the second in another or opposite way, and only the third, in the middle, is just right." (Booker, Page 231)
"This idea that the way forward lies in finding an exact middle path between opposites is of extraordinary importance in storytelling and, as we shall see, some of the ways in which it finds expression are of breathtaking subtlety." (Booker, Page 231)
Ways to resolve the third beat
So, how do you subvert expectations?
There are a number of ways to do this.
Hereâ€™s Robert McKee:
"The world of the character reacts differently than expected, more powerfully than expected, or both." (McKee, 144-145)
Manner: First, you can give your audience exactly what they expected, but in a manner they did not expect.
Degree: Another option is to follow expectations, but to change in degree, either greater or less than expected. 
Reversal: Reversing the trajectory can be just as effective. It's a technique commonly used in joke structure. Here's Howard Tayler from Writing Excuses:
Pure subversion: Lastly, you can give your audience something they did not expect, which, in hindsight, also matches the trajectory. This is pure subversion.
The surprise neednâ€™t be earth-shattering to be effective. A little twist can be just as much fun as a story-defining revelation.

The rule of three applies to many different scopes
The rule of three can apply on many different levels of storytelling. It can apply to simple lists, like the desk, lamp, and monster eating a burrito. It can apply to story beats. It can apply to scenes in a sequence, even whole stories.
For example, as Phillips points out in Dramatica, the rule of three can be applied to character interactions. 
"The first interaction sets the relationship between the two characters. The second interaction brings them into conflict. The third interaction shows which one fares better, proving one as more appropriate than the other." (Dramatica, Phillips, Location 3649)
