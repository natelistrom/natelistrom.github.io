<p class="summary"><strong>Summary:</strong> The best tools are designed to be ergonomic &mdash; to be fitted <em>to</em> people, rather than asking people to fit the tool. Similarly, as a storyteller, you should design your stories to fit the way people think.</p>

<p class="dropCap">In the 1940s, a psychologist named Paul Morris Fitts led an investigation into mistakes made by aircraft pilots or their crew members. He reviewed nearly three hundred documented cases, looking for patterns. Suprisingly, he found that the largest single group of errors &mdash; more than ten percent &mdash; were due to <em>exactly the same mistake</em>.</p> 

What was the mistake? Misreading the altimeter by exactly one thousand feet. <sup>{% include fittsAndJones-1947.html %}</sup>

## Designed to confuse

The altimeter is a little device that uses barometric pressure to tell a pilot how high above sea level the plane is flying. If the pilot knows both 1) his height above sea level and 2) the height of the ground, he can determine how high the plane is flying above the ground by subtracting the ground level from the reading on the altimeter.

For obvious reasons, getting this calculation correct is especially important when attempting to land the plane.

The designers of these altimeters faced an interesting challenge. Altimeters must provide a wide range of altitude &mdash; at the time, up to 40,000 feet. But, they must also provide a fine-grained definition between narrow distances during landing. A miscalculation of fifty feet could mean the difference between touching down on a runway or crashing into the field beyond.

This presented designers with a problem. If the gauge was optimized to show the full, 40,000 foot range, it would be useless to show the smaller distances. But if it showed the smaller distances with high enough granularity, the gauge couldn’t possibly show the full range &mdash; it would need to fill the entire cockpit. 
 
They settled upon a clever solution that repurposed a pattern that had been established for centuries. The gauges had multiple pointers, like a clock face. 
 
Each of three pointers on the altimiter represented a different scale increment. Combined, a pilot could read the three hands and calculate altitude with precision across the full, 40,000 foot range. It was ingenious.

And it was killing people.

## Patterns point to something deeper

Individually, each misreading that Fitts reviewed could be attributed to simple pilot error. But, taken together, it became clear that something else happening.

In the fractions of a second that pilots had available to glance at the reading, parse the positions of the three hands, and calculate a measurement, something was going wrong.

Perhaps it was that reading three hands under such conditions is too complex, and occasional error is inevitable.

Perhaps it was that, in such a short glance, pilots were confusing one hand for another. 
 
Perhaps it was that the location of the altimeter among the flight instruments created a parallax effect, where the height of the needles above the face caused them, at an angle, to appear transposed to another number. 
 
Regardless of the cause, the effect was disastrous.

## Design to fit people

This finding, and similar others like it, prompted Fitts to make a series of recommendations for changes to cockpit designs.
 
His overall gist was that cockpits should be designed with humans in mind — that the controls and gauges should be fitted to the way that humans naturally think and behave, rather than expecting the pilots to be fitted to the airplanes through training. #needtofix 
 
This fundamental shift — from fitting people to things to fitting things to people — is at the heart of a discipline now called Human Factors or, as might be more familiar to some, Ergonomics.
The key tenant of the discipline is to understand how people naturally think and behave and inhabit the world, and then shape products and interfaces and ideas to them. 
 
It’s similar to a woodworking mantra — “Don’t go against the grain.” In other words, there exist natural contours, and to ignore them is a recipe for failure.

On the other hand, if you cut with the grain, you have fine control and can create something truly beautiful. 
 
Where this becomes relevant for storytellers is that our audiences are human, too. They also fall under this kind of human-interface paradigm.

There are certain ways that audiences receive and process story information. Certain things that make ideas easier or more difficult to absorb and apply. 
 
If we go against the grain with these tolerances, we risk our stories being like the altimeters — engineered to express all the data, but failing to truly communicate it.
This is why some stories crash and burn. 
 
“I just couldn’t get into it.” “It was too unrealistic.” “It started off great but then went nowhere.” — these are the things you’ll hear from your audience. The truth is, the core idea for the story may have been the full 40,000 foot range, but if you miss the Human Factor, you may not communicate. 
 
So this is where we will start with our exploration of story, with the human factor, the things that make stories more accessible to our minds.

The first of these human factors, which we’ll explore next, is what I’m calling approachability — the basic, elemental things that make a story graspable and approachable. If a person can’t pick up your story and grasp it, they’ll have no hope of engaging with any of the things that come later. So, that’s where we’ll start.
And whatever happened to the altimeters? Further research landed on a handful of improvements, some of which have even made it into modern, digital cockpit displays today — and none of which rely on three hands like a clock.
