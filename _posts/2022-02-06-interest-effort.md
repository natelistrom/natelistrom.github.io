<p class="dropCap">As a storyteller, how do you capture an audience and hold their attention, keeping them engaged until your story's end? There are, of course, many ways to answer this question. One frame that I've found to be helpful is to think of audience engagement in terms of what I call the interest:effort formula.</p>

Every audience begins a story with a basic incentive. Often, it's simple curiosity or a desire to be entertained, but it may be more than that. Audiences also come to stories hoping to learn or be moved or make meaningful human connection. The audience's motivation is what I call the _interest_ component of the formula.

Audience interest starts small, often just a basic willingness to give a story a fair shake. It's like a tiny seedling pushing its way through the loamy soil in a dense forest. It can easily be crowded out by the undergrowth of distraction and alternative entertainment, anything that competes for your audience's attention.

Your job as a storyteller is to encourage your audience's interest and help it grow, to not let down their trust but instead exceed their expectations. 

Every story has practical, mechanical components: the use of language and imagery, exposition and setups, ordering of events and ideas. Converting these mechanical parts into meaningful experience is not free. It costs our brains cognitive energy. This is the _effort_ component of the formula. It's the work your audience must do in order to derive something from what you give them.

Your job as a storyteller is to honor their engagement by minimizing unnecessary effort and making necessary effort meaningful.

I like to think of interest and effort as weights placed on the opposite sides of a scale. The more weight on either side, the more likely the scale will tip. As a storyteller, you can get away with some effort, but you must offset the balance with a corresponding weight of interest. The more effort your story requires of the audience, the more interest you must provide to keep them motivated.

Another way to think about it is to imagine water pumping through a pipe. The steeper the incline and the longer the distance the water must travel (effort), the greater the pressure must be to get it to its destination (interest).

Of course, there's great variability in what makes a "good" balance of interest and effort. Thrillers tend to have high pressure and straight pipes: simple, straightforward prose and explosive narrative drive. Literary stories, in contrast, play more in imagery and ambiguity: pressure lower and paths more winding. Neither is inherently worse or better, but they are different, and they will attract different sorts of people. Connecting with an audience depends a lot on what the audience is seeking.

How do we use this formula in our storytelling?

The first thing is to work with intent. If you provide a steep interest:effort ratio, be sure you're doing it on purpose. It's one thing to knowingly challenge your audience to climb a mountain; it's something else to place a mountain in their way by accident. This is why we study craft. We should endeavor as storytellers to obtain the knowledge and skill to both understand and fully control when the paths we are laying for our audiences are difficult or easy. "Know the rules so that you can break them," as the adage goes.

The second thing is to compensate for effort, as much as the art allows, with appropriate interest. If you build a section of pipe pointing straight up into the sky, you’ll need a lot more pressure to get your liquid flowing through it than if it’s running down hill.

Of course, challenge is, itself, a legitimate expression of art. Like those who enjoy solving a difficult puzzle, there are audiences who seek these kinds of stories. Anyone who sticks it out through a particularly challenging narrative gains a sort of personal satisfaction at having done a hard thing.

But even in more approachable stories, some added effort can be beneficial. In _Story_, story theorist Robert McKee talks about the 'gap' that opens between audience expectation and what the story delivers.<sup>1</sup> Like a well-delivered joke, these gaps give room for the audience to step into the narrative and make the cognitive connection themselves. This takes cognitive effort — but it also engages audiences more deeply. (And, paradoxically, increases interest.)

The takeaway is this: within the scope of your artistic intent, add interest to make the effort less cumbersome along the way. A lonely climb up a mountain, hedged on both sides by bland, brick walls is much less enjoyable than the same climb with a friend, lines of boulders and forest trees on either side, and an occasional mountain bluff upon which to stop and admire the view.

The last thing to remember is that our choice of interest:effort ratio has implications. Straightforward "romps" are fun and easy. They're highly-tuned to favor interest over effort, and they entertain large audiences. But, they rarely stick with us for long. 

On the other hand, more "artsy" stories may be difficult or ambiguous. They can have a higher level of effort required and can be alienating or off-putting to many. But the questions they raise may deeply affect a person's worldview and stick with them for years.

Most of us, of course, want our stories to be both winsome and meaningful. To do that, we'll need to hone our craft and become deft at carefully manipulating the balance our our stories' interest:effort formulae.
