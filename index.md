## Start here

- ðŸ‘‰ **Discover the neuroscience behind emotional payoffs** with a 12-part series on [**peak aesthetic experiences**](/tag/peak+aesthetic+experiences.html).

- ðŸ‘‰ **Consider fresh perspectives on familiar topics** like [**scenes and sequels**]({% post_url 2022-10-24-scene-sequel-acts %}), the [**MICE quotient**]({% post_url 2022-11-13-mice-internal-external %}), [**red herrings**]({% post_url 2023-08-27-red-herrings-and-satisfying-twists %}), [**_Deus ex Machina_**]({% post_url 2023-08-12-deus-ex-machina-and-satisfying-story-ending %}), and [more](/notes.html).
